"""

 Example slave process. For now this has been set up as a separate
 thread although this is to make things clearer form an admin point
 of view as much as anything else. 

 The details of the architecture need to be settled. In the long run
 this needs to tie in with ExtendNMR.

 The main question is whether we need this specific manager layer and
 how we link this with the task code layer underneath.
