- Add 'logout' link to 'auth/logout' in title bar when in convert/ section

- Make 'auth/login' and 'auth/new' nice pages

- Create main index page

- Add persistent formatConverter object, per session. Do this via sessionMap

- Can currently log in user 'test' and 'test2' (via 2 tabs), both are accessing same session.
  If test logs out, test2 is also out. Need to make session specific!
  Need to use different SESSION_KEY?
