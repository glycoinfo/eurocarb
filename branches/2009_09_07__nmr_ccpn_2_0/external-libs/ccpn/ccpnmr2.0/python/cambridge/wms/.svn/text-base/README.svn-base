Source for WMS GUI. All the files are here except for the python web
service stubs and the wsdl file form which they are generated. For
these stubs, it is currently necessary to hand edit a wsdl file from
the server (remove the schema import and put it in by hand) and then
run wsdl2py with the -f option to generate the stubs.

The aim is to modify ZSI to handle the import statement in the near
future. At that point a lot of the code will change and remote methods
will be called directly.
