            <H2>Atom selection</H2>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">This window appears when no match was found for a resonance/atom name within the
		selected naming system.</P>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">'<B>Residue type</B>' lists the 3 letter code used for this residue.</P>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">'<B>Resonance</B>' lists the atom information as detected in the external files(s).
        Click on this button to see detailed information. If a chemical shift value is connected to this
        resonance, it will also be listed here.</P>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">Next to '<B>Pick atom</B>' a selection list appears that contains suggested matches for
        this resonance/atom. The atom names are IUPAC. If the desired atom is not present in this list, press
        the '<B>Show all atoms</B>' button at the bottom of the window to list all atoms available in this
        residue. Note that it is possible that the atom name from the external format is the same as the IUPAC
        name in this list - this happens when the naming system that is currently used for matching does not
        contain the external atom name.</P>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">For <B>prochiral atoms</B>, there will be four choices depending on the situation. For
        example, for the <B>HA protons for glycine</B> the following selections are possible:</P>
        <UL>
        <LI><B>HA*</B>: Both HA protons carry the same information (the resonance is linked to both HA2 and HA3
            and all information is shared with resonances linked to these atoms).
        <LI><B>HA2/HA3</B>: The HA protons carry separate information but are not stereospecifically assigned
            (the resonance is linked to both HA2 and HA3, but the NMR information linked to the current
            resonance is not shared with any other resonances)
        <LI><B>HA2 (stereo)</B>: Stereospecifically assign the resonance to the HA2 proton
        <LI><B>HA3 (stereo)</B>: Stereospecifically assign the resonance to the HA3 proton
        </UL>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">The atom name mapping you selected here can be propagated to other residues, so that
        identical external atom names will be automatically linked to the correct Data Model atom name. From
        the selector next to <B>Propagate mapping to</B>, select one of the following options:
        <UL>
        <LI><B>Only this residue</B>: Only use mapping for this particular residue.
        <LI><B>All residues with seqID x in same molecule(s)</B>: Use mapping for all residues with this
            sequence ID in all chains representing this molecule (e.g. residue 22 in homodimer chains A and B).
        <LI><B>All residues of XXX type in this chain</B>: Use mapping for all residues of a certain type (e.g.
            ILE), but only this chain
        <LI><B>All residues of XXX type in same molecule(s)</B>: Use mapping for all residues of a certain type
            (e.g. ILE) in all chains representing this molecule (e.g. chains A and B for a homodimer).
        <LI><B>All residues of XXX type in molSystem</B>: Use mapping for all residues of a certain type (e.g.
            ILE) in all chains in the molecular system (e.g. chains A and B for a heterodimer).
        <LI><B>All residues in chain</B>: Use mapping for all residues irrespective of type, but only in this
            chain. Best to use for backbone atoms only.
        <LI><B>All residues in same molecule(s)</B>: Use mapping for all residues irrespective of type in all
            chains representing this molecule (e.g. chains A and B for a homodimer). Best to use for backbone
            atoms only.
        <LI><B>All residues in molSystem</B>: for all residues irrespective of type in all chains in the
            molecular system (e.g. chains A and B for a heterodimer). Best to use for backbone atoms only.
        </UL> </P>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">Press '<B>Do not link</B>' if none of the atom names apply or you are not sure about
        the mapping. In this case the NMR information is still connected to the correct resonance, but it is
        not assigned to a particular (set of) atom(s), and you will not be able to export this information.</P>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">Press '<B>OK</B>' to continue after you have made your selections.</P>
