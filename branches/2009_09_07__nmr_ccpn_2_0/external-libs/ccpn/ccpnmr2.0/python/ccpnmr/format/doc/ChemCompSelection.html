            <H2>ChemComp selection window</H2>
        <P>This window can pop up for two reasons:
        <UL>
        <LI><B>An unknown residue/molecule code was found in a sequence file</B>: At this stage you can
        define the chemical component ('ChemComp') that describes this residue/molecule (if it is
        available). First, in the top half of the window, determine which chemical compound you want to
        use, and double click on its 'show details' column. The 'variants' for this chemComp will show up
        in the lower window. Select the one you require and click 'OK'. Note that you can use the <A
        href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/chempdb/cgi-bin/cgi.pl">MSDchem</A> service to find the
        correct CIF code for your chemComp (this will make searching much easier when a large number of
        compounds are available). 
        <LI><B>You want to select a variant of a known chemical compound</B>: Select the chemComp variant you
        require from the bottom window and click 'OK'.
        </UL>
        <P><B>What is a chemComp</B>: A 'ChemComp' contains the definitions of what makes up a chemical
        compound (e.g. the atoms, bonds, etc. found in an alanine residue, in glucose, ...). This
        information is derived from the <A href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd">E-MSD database</A>, but
        additional NMR specific information about naming systems, ...  was added for CCPN. The final
        information is stored in reference files in XML format.</P>
        <P>&nbsp;</P>
        <P>The top half of the window shows:</P>
        <UL>
        <LI><B>number</B>: a serial number for identification only
        <LI><B>show details</B>: double-click this column to show the chemComp variants in the bottom part of the window
        <LI><B>molType</B>: the 'molecular type' of the chemComp
        <LI><B>ccpCode</B>: the code used internally by CCPN for this chemComp
        <LI><B>code1Letter</B>: the one letter code for this chemComp (if any)
        <LI><B>cifCode</B>: the CIF code for this chemComp (if any)
        <LI><B>name</B>: the name of this chemComp
        </UL>
        <P>The button '<B>Show all in details window</B>' will list all available chemComps in the bottom
        window. The button '<B>Clear details window</B>' will remove all available chemComps from the
        bottom window.</P>
        <P>&nbsp;</P>
        <P>The bottom half of the window shows:</P>
        <UL>
        <LI><B>number</B>: a serial number for identification only
        <LI><B>molType</B>: the 'molecular type' of the chemComp
        <LI><B>ccpCode</B>: the code used internally by CCPN for this chemComp
        <LI><B>linking</B>: if part of a polymer, the sequence location of the chemCompVar
        <LI><B>descriptor</B>: the protonation/binding state of the chemCompVar
        <LI><B>molecularMass</B>: the  molecular weight of the chemCompVar
        <LI><B>formula</B>: the chemical formula of the chemCompVar
        <LI><B>nonStereoSmiles/stereoSmiles</B>: the SMILES representation(s) of the chemComp (if
        available).
        </UL>
        <P>Select the correct chemComp from the lower list and press <B>OK</B> to continue. If you cannot find the correct chemComp, press <B>CANCEL</B>. The sequence cannot be handled correctly in this case.</P>
