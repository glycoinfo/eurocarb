        <P ALIGN="LEFT">It is necessary to select a valid data source before the script can continue. A data source ('DataSource') describes the raw (acquisition) data for an experiment, or a particular transform of that raw data (e.g. if you process your data with both NMRPipe and Azara you would have three data sources: one for the acquisition data, one for NMRPipe and one for Azara. If you would do a different transform (e.g. a 2D projection of a 3D) you would also have to create a new datasource).

        <P ALIGN="LEFT">If available, press the '<B>create new datasource</B>' button if you have to create a new data source for this experiment in the Data Model.
