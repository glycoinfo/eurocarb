        <P ALIGN="LEFT">In this window you can copy <i>segments of data</i> from one project
        to another. For example, when you copy a peak list all associated peaks down to the
        assignments per peak dimension will be copied over.</P>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">First load in two projects: click on <i>'Select project file'</i> and
        select the main XML file for two different projects.</P>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">Then select the relevant object you want to copy over, either on the
        left or on the right side, and click the arrow in pointing away from the object you
        want to copy. This should copy over your data.</P>
        <P><b>Try to copy objects in the order they appear in the window (i.e. start with the
        molecular system!)</b></P>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">Note that the code tries to make sure that all essential information
        for a set of objects is copied over, although some minor connected objects may be
        lost.</P>
