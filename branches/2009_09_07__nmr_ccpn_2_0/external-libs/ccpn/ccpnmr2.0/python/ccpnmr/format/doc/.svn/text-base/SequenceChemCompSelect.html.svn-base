            <H2>Set chemComp information for an imported sequence.</H2>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">In this window you can delete or move sequence elements, and select the correct
		chemCompVar for a particular sequence element.</P>
        <P>On the left, under <B>'Original code'</B>, the original sequence identifier and code are displayed
        for information.</P>
        <P>In the middle, under <B>'Modify ChemCompVar'</B>, the currently selected (if any) reference data
        chemCompVar is displayed. If this chemCompVar is not defined or if you want to change it, you can click
        on it and a window will pop up that allows you to select the desired chemCompVar.</P>
        <P>On the right, under <B>'Status'</B>, you can modify the status of a particular sequence element. Each
        sequence element has a pulldown list that is set to 'OK' by default (this means the sequence element is
        in the right place in the sequence and has to be imported into the Data Model). If you set the status to
        'Delete', the sequence element will be removed from the sequence. You can also move sequence elements to
        other molecules - click on the <B>'Add new molecule'</B> button if you want to create another molecule
        to move sequence elements to. You can move a sequence element to the 'start' or the 'end' of another
        molecule (this only has meaning for linear polymers). Note that moving multiple sequence elements
        simultaneously to the 'start' of the same molecule will inverse their order from the one currently
        displayed!</P>
        <P>Press '<B>Change</B>' to implement the changes from the 'Status' column.</P>
        <P>Press '<B>Change and quit</B>' to implement the changes from the 'Status' column and return to the
		sequence linking window.</P>
        <P>Press '<B>Cancel</B>' to ignore everything that was done in this window.</P>
