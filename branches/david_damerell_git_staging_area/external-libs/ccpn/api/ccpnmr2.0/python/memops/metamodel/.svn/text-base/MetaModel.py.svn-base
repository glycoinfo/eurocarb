MetaModel Implementation information:

- allowedTags define the allowed tags, and the allowed ranges of their values.
See memops.metamodel.TaggedValues for further information

- parameterData give information for setting, checking and writing MetaModel 
attributes. It is used for attributes that may be given as input parameters -
internal implementation attributes are set explicitly.
parameterData has the following legal tags:

- 'default' describes the default setting of a parameter.
  It is an actual value, not a string representation.
  Anything without a default is a mandatory input parameter.
  
- 'type' is either a Python class or type (for direct type checking),
 or a string typeCode for cases where special checking is needed.
 The legal string typeCodes are: Boolean,  Token, StringDict, and content.
 The latter is used for private implementation attributes, to prevent
 overwriting. 
 If 'type' is not set, the parameter can be of any type ('object'). In practice
 there will generally be some kind of type checking in the checkValid function.
 An example would be the value constants (see below).

- 'namelist'. Allowed only for type == 'content'. Content is stored in a shared
  dictionary (elementDict). The namelist is the name of the attribute that holds
  the relevant list of names to extract a subset from the elementDict. E.g. the
  parameter 'classes' will have as a 'namelist' attribute the list of contained
  class names.

- 'hicard' is the maximum number of objects. Default is 1. Any other number,
including unlimited (infinity), means this is a list.

- 'enumeration' means the parameter must be within the enumerated list of values

- 'isFixed' means that the parameter must be identical to its default

- 'setterFunc' is the name of a function that is called on setting of the 
MetamodelElement attribute, instead of the standard setting code. It serves
for attributes/links that needs more complex actions than just setting a value.
if is is set to 'unsettable', the attribute may not be set.

- 'getterFunc' is the name of a function that is called on getting of the 
MetamodelElement attribute, instead of the standard getting code. It serves
for attributes/links that needs more complex actions than just getting a value

__setattr__ and __getattr__ take care of type checking, and information hiding.
Other checking is done only in checkValid.


Implementation attributes are in principle private, and start with '__'
following the standard Python convention. Also following standard Python
the private attributes can be accessed from the outside, and sometimes are.
Non-implementation attributes are generally kept in the normal __dict__, 
and are exported directly. Collections and dictionaries, which can not be 
exported directly, are kept in the __dataDict dictionary.
Contained elements are kept in the __elementDict or __constraints dictionaries.
New attribtues can be freely defined. These are kept in the __dict__ as for 
normal Python objects.
The _tempData dictionary has no parameterData record and is treated as a 
'new attribute'. It is used for temporary information storage during
object creation. For valid objects it must be empty.

Some of the business rules for MetaClass parameters are enforced in the 
finaliseMetaClass function.

#############################################################################

Value constants:

MetaDataType.enumeration, MetaConstant.value, MetaAttribute.defaultValue and
MetaParameter.defaultValue are all value constants, and must be of MetaDataType
type. They are passed in as python values (not strings). The implementation
checks their validity using MetaDataType.isValid.

#############################################################################

General rules:

- The MetaModelElement.isImplicit attribute is used for elements that are
generated automatically in the course of code generation. By definition all
information in these elements can be derived from other, non-temporary
elements. Implicit elements are not written to disk when the model is stored.

- A number of elements, mainly operations, are generated automatically. 
Accordingly, name clashes may appear only during code generation, and possibly
for certain implementations only. To avoid duplication there is no up-front
check against such name clashes, and it is not known for sure if the model is
valid in this respect until all implementation generations have been tried.

#############################################################################

Names:

 - Element names are of type Token. This means they must be made of digits, 
 lower and upper case letters, and underscore, and may not start with a digit.
 
 - Some names have length limits: MetaClass names, 
 ClassElement names, and package shortNames. See relevant checkValid for details
 
 - Names that start with underscore ('_') are valid only for implicit elements.
 Autogenerated elements may start with underscore.
 Implementation attributes, functions etc. should start with underscore
 
 - As a matter of style, the names of AbstractDataTypes, constants, exceptions
 and packages not containing other packages should start with upper case, 
 and names of AbstractValues and MetaOperations should start with lower case.
 Except for MetaOperations, no element name should contain an underscore.
 
 - Some names may conflict with naming rules in certain implementations or
 programming languages. These are mapped to different names. Where possible the
 mapping is used only internally in the implementation, but there may be cases
 (like Python reserved words) that require changing the publicly  visible name.
 The usename attribute is intended for such renaming. It is  temporary, intended
 for use by ModelAdapt, and is reset when packages are reset. Usename attributes
 are ignored in model comparison if ignoreImplicit  is set to True.
 NBNB TBD Usename is not yet in ue in the generation machinery

#############################################################################
   
Packages:

  Packages serve to organise both the Model description, the API code,
  and the data storage. 
  All elements of the data model are contained in packages.
  All packages are ultimately contained in a single, topmost package,
  currently called RootPackage (the name is set in ImpConstants). The name of
  this package is omitted in qualified package names.
  Package memops.Implementation (name may change in later versions), is reserved
  for the implementation, and must be imported by all other packages. 
  Similarly memops.AccessControl must eb imported by all packages except
  itself and Implementation.
  
  Packages are linked to each other through the following relationships:

  - Containment:
   Package A contains package B.
   A package P that contains other packages can contain nothing else, and does
   not correspond to Model, API Code or Data files. Packages such as P serve
   only to organise the other packages and are implemented as a directory
   structure for Model and code files. Packages that contain other packages
   cannot import or be imported by other packages. 

  - Import:  Importing a package makes it known to the importing package, but
   the two remain distinct and do not share a namespace (for Code) or mix their
   data in the same file (for Data). Code from imported packages are implemented
   with 'import otherPackage' in Python. Elements from the imported packages can
   be used in most ways at the Code level. The only exception is that a class
   cannot have subclasses in another package if it is non-abstract or involved
   in a link. Abstract, derived, and implementation links are excempt from this
   rule. There is one exception to this: The link between
   AccessControl.AccessObject and Implementation.DataObject is specifically
   allowed, at the cost of adding some special hacks to the code generation.

   If package A imports package B, B is in A.importedPackages, and  A is in
   B.accessedPackages. Links that cross package boundaries must be navigable
   from the importing package to the imported package, and may be navigable both
   ways. If navigable both ways, information about the link (at both model, code
   and data level) are kept solely in the importing package. When
   loading a package of data in a file implementation, loading of imported
   packages of data are  triggered automatically. Links that are mandatory
   (locard != 0) or frozen  (changeablility == frozen) must be towards an
   imported (rather than accessed) package.

#############################################################################
 
 Constraints:

 - Constraints may be used for all ConstrainedElements, except MetaParameters.

 - Constraints may not be attached to derived elements

 - Constraints are evaluated in check_valid and also before modifying the 
  data in modifier functions (set and add/remove)

 - Constraints attached to MetaClasses and MetaDataObjTypes are evaulated only 
  in check_valid.

 - Constraint codeStubs are given in the manner of tagged values. The precise
 rules for values may vary slightly by language
. For Python they are given as 
  python code strings, correctly indented starting flush left, with two spaces 
  indent, and may not contain multiline strings. Note that the rules for code
  stubs are not checked in the checkValid function. Their correctness as code
  can be checked only on compilation/testing of the final API.
  The code may make use of 'self' and 'value' or their language equivalents.
  For Constraints on MetaDataTypes only 'value' may be used, For constraints
  on MetaClasses and MetaDataObjTypes only 'self' may be used.

 - Constraints where 'self' is allowed are always evaluated on fully formed 
 objects in a legal state. They may therefore assume the existence of any 
 mandatory attributes and links etc. It is recommended to prefer constraints
 that are evaluated in modifier operations, i.e. to use MetaClass and
 MetaDataObjType constraints only if nothing else will serve.
 Constraints on attributes that make use only of 'value' should ideally be
 avoided in  favour of creating constrained data types - this allows
 verification of the values as an alternative to try-except, at least in 
 principle

 - Constraints on ClassElements with hicard != 1 are evaluated for each
 individual object in the collection ('value' is set successively to each
 object rather than to the set of objects).Constraints on the collection as
 such must be implemented as constraints on the containing MetaClass or
 MetaDataObjType.
 
 The following rules are at least partially verified in checkValid:
 
 - There can be no constraints on derived links or parent/child links.

 - Constraints on roles across package boundaries must be on the importing side.

 - For intra-package links, Constraints for one-to-many (or many-to-one)
  binavigable links must be located so they constrain the -to-one link. For
  other binavigable links constraints can be put on either side of the
  association, but all constraints must be on the same side. The location of the
  constraint in the Model makes no difference to its evaluation.

 - Constraints may be given in two different notations:
  1) a string that when executed sets the variable 'isValid' to a truth value
  and that contains the string 'isValid'
  2) a single line that evaluates to a truth value and that does not contain
  the string 'isValid'.

#############################################################################

Organisation of Objects and Classes:

Except for multiple inheritance (see below), all classes must be a subclass of
the topmost base class  (currently called MemopsObject). NonAbstract classes in
the Implementation package must further be subclasses of ImplementationObject,
while all classes outside Implementation must be subclasses of DataObject. All
MetaDataObjTypes must be subclasses of MemopsDataTypeObject.

All non-abstract classes have a link to another class called the parent class.
This link must be mandatory (1..1) and frozen, and defined as a composition
link in UML (filled black diamond). UML composition is used only for this 
purpose. The name of the link can be anything. 
The set of parent-child links form a tree rooted in the MemopsRoot class; a 
MemopsRoot object has no parent and has no UML composition link.

Subtypes of TopObject are children of the MemospRoot object; all other
classes except MemospRoot are children of a class in the same package.

All classes (abstract or not) with a non-abstract parent link must have a
mainkey, unless the parent-child link is  one-to-one. This mainkey is a set of
attributes and/or links of the whose value identifies it uniquely among the
objects with the same class and the same parent object. The parent-child links
define a unique path from the Project object to each object, and knowing the
mainkeys alows you to chose the right object at each step on the path. The
precise rules for parent and mainkeys in the presence of inheritance are
described below.

Rules governing parents and keys:

 - All non-abstract classes have a parent, except for class Project. 
   The parent-child links form a tree.

 - Parent-child links may be either one-to-many or one-to-one.
   The latter are referred to as 'only children'.

 - All classes with a non-abstract parent have a mainkey, except for only 
   children. Only children have no mainkey.

 - The local key ('mainkey') of each object must define it uniquely within the
  link to its parent object.

 - The local key consists of an attribute, a link, or an ordered tuple of 
  attributes and links.

 - Only attributes and links belonging to a class can be used as keys for
  the class. These may originally have been defined in either the class or a
  superclass.

 - All attributes and links partaking in a local key must be frozen non-derived,
 and mandatory, and locard must be equal to hicard. Cardinality 0..1 is 
 forbidden, even though it could in theory be accomodated. Links to classes in
 accessed (i.e. not imported) packages are not allowed as keys.
 
 - TopObject keys may only contain attributes and links to other TopObjects

 - The global key ('key') of an object is a list concatenating the local keys
 of itself and all its parents, starting at root level and going down.

 - The combination of class name, and global key must be a unique
 object identifier. Each object and non-abstract class must have a key.

 - The key serves to provide a unique identifying string for each object, for
  use in both GUI, object printing, and interfile references.

 - An abstract superclass may have a key defined. If it does not, the subclasses
  have individual definitions for their keys. These keys need bear no 
  relationship to each other.

 - Parent-child links between two abstract classes may be abstract. These links
  are overridden by links between the subclasses of the abstract classes.
  Abstract classes may have abstract one-way parent links to non-abstract 
  classes.

 - Keys and parents cannot be overridden in subclasses. It follows that if a
  superclass has a key (parent link), that key (parent link) is the same for 
  its subclasses. An abstract class can have a key even if it does not have a 
  parent..

 - A class may not have two different child classes (including subclasses) with
  the same name.

#############################################################################

Cardinalities:

Attributes with hicard == 1 must be isUnique=True, isOrdered=False

In the current implementation, two-way links must have isUnique=True at
both ends. This could be relaxed, but the code generation machinery does not
currently support it correctly.

To allow for (presumed) problems with database implementations, two-way links
are not allowed to have isOrdered=True at both ends.

There are no limitations on attributes, one-way links, derived links, or
Implementation links.

#############################################################################
  
Rules governing inheritance:

 - Multiple inheritance is allowed, as follows:
The base class for MetaClasses is MemopsObject; 
The base class for MetaDataTypeObjects is MemopsDataTypeObject.
Inheritance follows the Python model: depth-first, following the order of
 supertypes. Diamond inheritance is handled by keeping only the last 
 occurrence in the list of supertypes for any class.
Each class can have at most one direct superclass that inherits from 
 the base.
If present this class must be first in the list of supertypes.
Non-abstract MetaClasses and MetaDataTypeObjects must descend from the base.
Only MetaClasses that descend from the base may participate in non-abstract 
links.
Only classes that descend from the base may have elements that override
 elements of other classes.
The first supertype in the list is returned as obj.supertype (derived) and 
 obj.getSupertype().
For languages that do not allow multiple inheritance (possibly for all 
 languages) classes that do not descend from the base are merged into their 
 subclasses before code generation starts.
  
 - Superclasses involved in links can not have subclasses in other packages, 
  unless the links are abstract, derived, implementation, or the specific
  link between AccessControl.AccessObject and Implementation.DataObject.
 
 - Non-abstract MetaDataObjTypes may not have subtypes in other packages. 
  
 - Most metaAttributes and metaLinks are present in both a type and its
  supertype. Contained elements (AbstractValues and MetaOperations) and
  MetaConstraints are only present in the Element where they belong, but are
  valid for all subtypes as well. Functions that get elements by name will
  automatically look in all supertypes till it finds the desired element.
  Functions that get lists of elements come in two versions, 'get' and
  'getAll'. The 'get' version (in Python replaced by the standard obj.attr
  syntax) will get only the elements contained directly, while the getAll
  version gets elements from both the object and its supertype objects.

 - Operations may override each other. The name and number of parameters must be
  the same, except for constructors. Most attributes must be the same in the
  overriding and overridden operations, but container, guid, documentation, and
  code stubs may be different. Tagged values must be the same, but the
  overriding operation and its parameters may have extra tagged values.
  Parameter defaults may also differ. The rules for MetaOperation targets depend
  on their type. For targets of ClassElement type the target of the overriding
  operation must override the target of the overridden operation. For
  MetaParameter valueTypes the type of the overriding parameter must be a
  subtype of the type of the overridden parameter.

 - Associations and roles may be overridden only if they are defined as 
  abstract.
  The cardinality of the overriding element must be a subset of the
  cardinality of the overridden.
  If the abstract element has high-cardinality different from one, the
  overriding element must also have high-cardinality different from one.
  The valueType of the overriding element must be a subtype of the 
  valueType of the overridden. Overriding attributes may have a defaultValue
  if the overridden attribute does not, but may not override actual default 
  values.
  Otherwise all parameters except 'isAbstract', 'container', 'documentation', 
  'changeability', 'isDerived', 'guid', and 'constraints' must be the same for 
  abstract and overriding association. Constraints and tagged values defined 
  for the overridden attribute are inherited down and may not be overridden.
  The overriding role may have extra constraints and tagged values.
  
  There are extra rules for overriding of Associations:
  Abstract associations must be overridden in all non-abstract subclasses,
  and abstract roles must be contained in abstract classes. 
  The overriding associations must be between subclasses of these classes.
  Unless both the overridden role is one-way, the otherRoles must override 
  each other like the roles. Note that an abstract one-way association may 
  be overriddden by a two-way asociation.
 
 - MetaParameters may override each other without restraint if both are
 implicit. Otherwise most attributes must be identical. The two may differ in
 container (obvously), the overriding parameter may have extra
 tagged values, and the its valueType may be a subtype of the one it is 
 overriding.
 The cardinality of the overriding element must be a subset of the
 cardinality of the overridden.
 If the abstract element has high-cardinality different from one, the
 overriding element must also have high-cardinality different from one.
 The MetaParameter rules apply equally to parameters of MetaExceptions
 and their supertypes, and to parameters of MetaOperations and the
 MetaOperations they override.
  
 
#############################################################################

 Special cases:
 
 - The isAutomatic attribute in ClassElement is used for attributes or links
 that are set automatically by the implementation, but that must then be stored
 and loaded normally. Currently it is used only for 'serial', but timestamps 
 would be an obvious case.
 
 - The attribute name 'serial' (given in serial_attribute) is used for object
 serial numbers. The code for handling this is hardwired. Attributes with this
 name are illegal in DataObjTypes.
 Attributes with this name must be of type Int, cardinality 1..1, 
 isAutomatic == True, and changeability = frozen.
 
#############################################################################

 Rules for operations :
 
 - The legal opTypes for public functions are given in 
 memops.metamodel.OpTypes.operationData
 opTypes are divided in groups 'query', 'modify', 'create', 'delete' and
 'other'.
 
 Operations have a 'target' that describes what the operation is acting on.  
 Operations that are linked to attributes and roles (e.g. get, set, add, remove,
 findFirst, findAll) have the attribute or role as target. The role or attribute
 must belong to the class itself. Factory functions(opType 'new') have the class
 being created as target.  There are also a number of functions that operate on
 the object containing  them (opTypes 'init', and the 'delete' and 'checkValid'
 opTypes); these have the containing class as target. They generally have the
 same name as their opType and are not inherited. All operations mentioned so
 far are generated automatically, but may be overridden by handwritten
 alternatives. Operations of these types may not be entered where there is no
 autogenerated version to override.

 There are also operations that can only be entered by hand and have no
 autogenerated equivalent. These have the opTypes 'otherQuery', 'otherModify',
 'otherCreate', 'otherDelete', and 'other'. For technical reasons to do with
 the implementation of fine-grained access control, these functions have
 themselves.as targets.
 
 - Operation subOpTypes distinguish operation variants. This is intended
 for languages that allow several overloaded operations with the same name but
 different calling interfaces. 
 
 - Names of operations with attribute or role targets and of factory functions
 are generally made by concatenating the opType and the target name (with first
 letter in upper case). These are inherited. 

 - Operations are given in the following circumstances:
  'get' functions: for all elements. For derived elements the function must
  be explicitly defined.
  'set' functions: for all elements except parent/child links and derived 
  unchangeable elements. For derived changeable elements the function must
  be explicitly defined. Unchangeable elements, links where the other end is 
  unchangeable, and automatic elements all have private set functions; these
  will throw an error unless isReading or override are set when they are called.
  They are intended for use by the implementation only. 
  - 'add' functions: for all elements with hicard != 1
   with the same exceptions as for 'set'
  - 'remove' functions: for all elements with hicard != 1
   with the same exceptions as for 'set'
  - 'sorted': for all elements with hicard != 1 and isOrdered==False
    These functions return a sorted list of the linked-to objects.
    For childlinks the list is sorted by local key, 
    in other cases by (class, fullKey).
  - 'findFirst' functions: for all roles or DataObjType attributes 
    with hicard != 1 without exception
  - 'findAll' functions: for all roles or DataObjType attributes 
     with hicard != 1 without exception
  findFirst returns the first element fitting the search criteria. For 
  unordered collections the function may return any element that fulfills
  the search criteria.
  findAll returns a list of all elements fitting the criteria.
  For implementations with access control the 'find' commands will ignore 
  objects where the caller does not have appropriate permission, whereas
  'get' will either return all objects or throw an error.

 - Operations will only be given explicitly in the UML model where they differ
  from the autogenerated norm. They will be fully specified, except that 
  parameters will be given explicitly only for the 'other' opTypes.
  Any operation given explicitly in the model will be non-autogenerated.
  The code must be given in the codeStubs attribute.

 - Code stub rules may differ between languages. Python code stubs are given 
  as a string, correctly indented starting flush left, with two spaces indent. 
  code:python will not work correctly with 
  multiline strings, as the indentation is modified by adding initial spaces. 
  The code is intended to be transformed into a method of the class, and uses 
  'self' as normal for such methods. Note that the rules for code
 stubs, are not checked in the checkValid function. Their correctness as code
 can be checked only on compilation/testing of the final API.
  For operations that return a value the code must set a parameter called
  'result' (or its language equivalent) to the desired value.
  As a matter of style single-input-parameter functions of 'other' opType should
  have the parameter called 'value'.

 - The ComplexDataType attribute constructorCodeStubs contains code stubs to
  add to the class constructor. The code stub is added after the end of object 
  creation but before the validation check. It is intended to handle 
  creation of mandatory child objects, and other operations that modify the
  data. It is not executed if isReading==True or override == True.
  Syntax as for MetaOperation code stubs. It is illegal for abstract 
  ComplexDataTypes.

 - The MetaClass attribute destructorCodeStubs contains code stubs to
  add to the class destructor. The code is added during checking of which
  objects to delete, before any data are changed, and should not modify the data
  either. It is intended to constrain when objects may legally be deleted. 
  Syntax as for MetaOperation code stubs. It is illegal for abstract 
  Classes.

 - Operations with opTypes that are normally autogenerated may not have explicit
 parameters; Metaparameters in these cases are generated automatically.
 
 Optional parameters are those with cardinality 0..1. These can only be input
 parameters. If no explicit default value is given, the default is automatically
 set to None. Default parameters are stored as actual values (not strings).
 
 Parameters of collection type (hicard != 1) may be optional if a default 
 value is provided. 
 
#############################################################################

 Rules for code tagged values :
 
 Codestubs are used in Constraints, Operations and in ComplexDataTypes 
 (constructor and destructor code). codestubs are always StringDicts.
 The dictionary key may consist of up to three parts, with a colon (':')
 as separator. The three parts are interpreted as 
 'language:implementation:variant'
 The same rules are used for DataType.typeCodes
