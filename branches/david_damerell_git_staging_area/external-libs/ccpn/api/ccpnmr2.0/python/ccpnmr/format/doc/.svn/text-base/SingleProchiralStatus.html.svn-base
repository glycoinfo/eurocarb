        <P ALIGN="LEFT">Here you decide how to handle cases where, in the external files, information was found
        for only one of two prochiral resonances/atoms (e.g. info for the HB2 of an ASP, but nothing for the
        HB3). The options are:</P>
        <UL>
        <LI><B>X assigned, has same information as Y</B>: Assume the other prochiral (X) carries the same
            information as this one (Y). In practice this means they have the same chemical shift.
        <LI><B>X not assigned, no stereo information</B>: Nothing is known about the other prochiral X (i.e.
            you cannot find it in the spectra); do not create a resonance for it.
