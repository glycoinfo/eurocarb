        <LI><B>Run linkResonances</B>: Run this script after you have read in
            sequence and NMR information. It links the Data Model Resonances to
            Atoms, effectively assigning the NMR information to particular
            atom(s).
        <LI><B>Check stereo status prochirals</B>: Set the stereospecific
            assignment status for resonances assigned to prochiral atoms.
        <LI><B>Create chemical shifts from peaklist(s)</B>: Create chemical
			shift list based on peak list(s) in the Data Model.
        <LI><B>Group chemical shifts for deposition</B>: Display the percentage
			of atoms that are currently assigned (based on atom groupings).
        <LI><B>Write resonance->atom mapping file</B>: Write out a text file
			with the resonance to atom links.
        <LI><B>Write BMRB chem shift deposition</B>: This allows you to write a
            BMRB chemical shift deposition file (<I>Note: this is for NMR-STAR
            v2.1.1 only. It should work fine in most cases as long as shifts are
            written out chain by chain.</I>)
