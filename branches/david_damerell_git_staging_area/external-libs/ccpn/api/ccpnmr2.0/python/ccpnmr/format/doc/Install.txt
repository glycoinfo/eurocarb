CcpNmr FormatConverter 2.0 installation notes

For general release notes see README file.

The third-party applications required are Python 2.4 and Tcl/Tk 8.4. 
Users who want to use their own copies of this code can do so.
FormatConverter will not work with Python < 2.4 but also works
with Python 2.5.  FormatConverter should also work with newer
Tcl/Tk 8.x distributions.

To install the code go into the ccpnmr directory (the top-level
directory of the distribution) and run the installCode.py script:
 
  python installCode.py format
 
This assumes that your computer has a working version of Python.
Any version >= 2.2 should work to run the script, but you need
version >= 2.4 for the code itself to run.
The script will then ask you what you want compiled, and for
anything not compiled where the relevant directory of the existing
code is.  It will then create a "bin" directory.  Finally, it will
ask whether you want to test the FormatConverter program by
starting it up.  This is recommended since it will check whether
the installation has been successful.  It will take a few seconds
because all of the Python code will have to be compiled.

*********Start of Interlude***************************************
 
Alternatively, if for some reason the script does not work, below is
what you need to do to install the code (CCPNMR_TOP_DIR is the ccpnmr
directory created by the unpacking of the tar file):
 
(1) If you need our version of Tcl:
      cd $CCPNMR_TOP_DIR/tcl8.4
    Unpack tar file:
      tar xvzf tcl8.4.14.tar.gz
      (or "gunzip" followed by "tar xvf" if your tar does not understand "z")
    Compile code:
      cd tcl8.4.14/unix
      ./configure --prefix=$CCPNMR_TOP_DIR/tcl8.4
      make
      make install
 
(2) If you need our version of Tk:
      cd $CCPNMR_TOP_DIR/tk8.4
    Unpack tar file:
      tar xvzf tk8.4.14.tar.gz
      (or "gunzip" followed by "tar xvf" if your tar does not understand "z")
    Compile code:
      cd tk8.4.14/unix
      ./configure --prefix=$CCPNMR_TOP_DIR/tk8.4 --with-tcl=$CCPNMR_TOP_DIR/tcl8.4/lib
      (or your own "with-tcl" argument if you are not using our Tcl)
      make
      make install
 
(3) If you need our version of Python:
      cd $CCPNMR_TOP_DIR/python2.4
    Unpack tar file:
      tar xvzf Python-2.4.2.tgz
      (or "gunzip" followed by "tar xvf" if your tar does not understand "z")
    Edit setup:
      cd Python-2.4.2
      copy Modules/Setup.dist to Modules/Setup
      edit Modules/Setup:
        below the line that says "# The _tkinter module." edit the lines as instructed
    Compile code:
      (In the Python-2.4.2 directory.)
      ./configure --prefix=$CCPNMR_TOP_DIR/python2.4
      make
      make install
 
*********End of Interlude*****************************************

After successful installation of the code the following environment
variables also need setting or updating (for example, in .cshrc):

  CCPNMR_TOP_DIR must be set to the top level directory of the release
  PYTHONPATH must include $CCPNMR_TOP_DIR/ccpnmr2.0/python
  PATH must include $CCPNMR_TOP_DIR/bin

For example, in .cshrc you could place:

  setenv CCPNMR_TOP_DIR directory_where_you_unpacked_release/ccpnmr
  setenv PATH ${CCPNMR_TOP_DIR}/bin:{$PATH}
  setenv PYTHONPATH .:${CCPNMR_TOP_DIR}/ccpnmr2.0/python

Your PATH and PYTHONPATH might need to include other things:  to
illustrate this the example of PATH above includes other directories
previously defined to be in PATH.

On Windows2000:

  Go to Settings / System / Advanced / Environment Variables...

  Create a new (or edit existing) 'User variable':

    Variable: CCPNMR_TOP_DIR
    Value:    directory_where_you_unpacked_release/ccpnmr
	
	...and so on
