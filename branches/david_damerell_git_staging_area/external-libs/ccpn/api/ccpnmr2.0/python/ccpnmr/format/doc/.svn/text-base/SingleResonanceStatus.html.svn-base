        for only one of two resonances/atoms that are often equivalent (e.g. info for the HD2 of a PHE, but
        nothing for the HD1). The options are:</P>
        <UL>
        <LI><B>X and Y are equivalent</B>: Assume that both atoms are equivalent (i.e. treat 'HD2' as 'HD*')
        <LI><B>X and Y are not equivalent</B>: Assume that these atoms are not equivalent (they are observed
            separately, so treat 'HD1' and 'HD2' as separate).
