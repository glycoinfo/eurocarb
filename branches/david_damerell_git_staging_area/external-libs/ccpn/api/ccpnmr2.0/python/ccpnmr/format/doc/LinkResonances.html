            <H2>Link resonances setup</H2>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">In this window you can set the parameters for running the linkResonances script. This
        script is essential to fully assimilate the assignments from external data files into the Data Model.</P>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">To run this script, you will need to have created on the one hand a valid <b>molecular
        system</b> with chains, residues and atoms (try Import->Single Files->Sequence), and on the other hand
        <b>resonances</b>. These resonances will be created automatically when you import NMR information (e.g.
        chemical shift lists, ...). This script will then link the existing resonances to existing atoms. To
        run it, select your preferred settings and click '<B>Link resonances to atoms</B>' to start.</P>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">The following options are available:</P>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">'<B>File format reference</B>': The data formats of the external files you imported are
        listed here. You can only run linkResonances on one data format at a time - rerun the script if you
        imported from multiple data formats.</P>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">'<B>Try to link unrecognized atom names</B>': If selected, a popup will appear if
        the script is not able to recognize an atom name from the external file(s). You will be prompted to
        select the correct atom match in such cases.</P>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">'<B>Try IUPAC names (as backup)</B>': If selected, atom names from the external
        file(s) that are not recognized within the selected naming system will also be matched against IUPAC
        names.</P>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">'<B>Use ambiguous name information</B>': If selected, ambiguous names will be
        translated; some atom names (e.g. HG* for THR) will be converted using their expected meaning (in this
        case to HG1 and HG2*). Use with care as this can result in misassignments.</P>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">'<B>Complete stereospecific assignment</B>': If selected, all prochiral atoms are
        assumed to be stereospecifically assigned.</P>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">'<B>Force shift merges</B>': If selected, ambiguous chemical shift values (two or more
        values in one chemical shift list for the same resonance) will be merged automatically. The average of
        all values will be used as the new value.</P>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">'<B>Status other atom for all single prochiral atoms</B>': This determines how to
        handle cases where, in the external files, information was found for only one of two prochiral
        resonances/atoms (e.g. info for the HB2 of an ASP, but nothing for the HB3). The options are:</P>
        <UL>
        <LI><B>Unknown</B>: Handle each case individually (a popup will appear).
        <LI><B>Same information</B>: Always assume the other prochiral contains the same information (i.e. they
			have the same chemical shift)
        <LI><B>Always ignore</B>: Always assume that nothing is known about the other prochiral (i.e. you
			cannot find it in the spectra); do not create a resonance for it.
        </UL>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">'<B>Status other atom for all possibly equivalent single atoms</B>': This determines
        how to handle cases where, in the external files, information was found for only one of two
        resonances/atoms that are often equivalent (e.g. info for the HD2 of a PHE, but nothing for the HD1).
        The options are:</P>
        <UL>
        <LI><B>Unknown</B>: Handle each case individually (a popup will appear).
        <LI><B>Always equivalent</B>: Always assume that the atoms are equivalent (i.e. treat 'HD2' as 'HD*')
        <LI><B>Always ignore</B>: Always assume that the single atom is not equivalent (i.e. treat 'HD1' and
			'HD2' as separate)
        </UL>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">'<B>Use minimal number of popups</B>': If selected, a minimal number of popups will
        appear. <B>Warning:</B> this also means that the script will make as many automatic choices as
        possible, and these might not always be to your liking!</P>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">'<B>Verbose output</B>': If selected, detailed information on how the linkResonance
        script handles the data will be printed out.</P>
