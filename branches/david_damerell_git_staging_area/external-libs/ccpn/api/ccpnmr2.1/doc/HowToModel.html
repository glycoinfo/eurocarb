<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="Getting the CCPN code:|outline"></A>Getting
the CCPN code:</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For those who want to do modeling, the
CCPN repository including the Memops generation machinery, is on
SourceForge at http://sourceforge.net/projects/ccpn/. Download it in
the normal way. I shall refer to the topmost directory as 'cvsroot';
it should contain directories doc/, python/, model/, etc.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If you do not want to model, but only
to use the generated APIs, we recommend you download from
http://www.ccpn.ac.uk/downloads/downloads.html - the installation
script there will make it easier for you.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="Installing ObjectDomain :|outline"></A>Installing
ObjectDomain :</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">You can get hold of ObjectDomain
through http://www.objectdomain.com. There is a 30-say test version,
but this does not allow you to save if you have more than 30 classes
in your model, which is barely enough for testing. For any serious
work you need a paid-for version. 
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="Set-up:|outline"></A>Set-up:</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">You need Python 2.2 or higher to run
the CCPN programs. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For set-up you need to have
cvsroot/python in your PYTHONPATH. In the tcsh shell I have :<BR>setenv
PYTHONPATH
/home/rhf22/CCPN/LIB/ccpnmr/python2.2/Python-2.2.3:/home/rhf22/CCPN/cvsroot/python</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When you have installed ObjectDomain,
go into the ObjectDomain directories, and edit the file
toplevel/python/scripts/odUserSetup.py, <BR>adding the following two
lines:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">import
sys<BR>sys.path.append('/home/rhf22/CCPN/cvsroot/python')</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">using the full path to cvsroot/python.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="Using ObjectDomain:|outline"></A>Using
ObjectDomain:</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The screen is divided in five areas: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The diagram view (top right),
	where most of the editing gets done.</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Python shell, (bottom right),
	for running scriptsand anything you want a Python shell for.</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The contents tree (top left), to
	select where you want to go.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The current contents, (middle
	left), showing the contents of what is curently selected in the
	contents tree. Things with two ends, such as links, inheritance,
	etc. will be shown as contained in one (and only one) of the classes
	they connect.</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The world view (bottom left) to
	move and zoom the diagram view.</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Controls and places to look for things
are generally intuitive.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Double clicking an object in the
	diagram view, contents tree, or world view will open the edit object
	popup, where you set most attributes of objects. To edit the
	appearance in the diagram of an object, use right mouse in the
	diagram view, and select 'Edit View'. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Double clicking a diagram in the
	content tree or current content will open it.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some actions, like creating a new
	class diagram, can best be done from the contents tree, e,.g. right
	mouse-&gt;create-&gt;Class Diagram on the containing package.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moving an existing class into a
	diagram is done by dragging it from the contents tree.</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deleting an object from a diagram view
will only remove the image - when you remove the last image you will
be asked whether to remove the object from the model. Deleting an
object form the contents tree will delete it permanently.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Standard modeling actions are done from
the menu bar below the diagram view. The one you will need most are
'New Class' (second from left), 'Create Link' (unadorned line with
two right angles), 'Make Inheritance' (fully drawn broadheaded arrow
pointing up), and 'Make Parent/Child Link' ('Create Link' with filled
black diamond). The only other one you will ever need is 'Create
Dependency' (dotted arrow pointing up and right). 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When using the 'edit object' popup,
text that is typed is not stored unless you click on something else
in the popup before you close. A bit of experimenting will get you
used to this.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A specific problem is that the normal
way of removing a superclass from inside the 'edit object' popup does
not work. You can do it by using right mouse 'delete' in the current
contents area, or by selecting and deleting the inheritance arrow on
the diagram view.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="Test Modeling:|outline"></A>Test
Modeling:</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For a quick test with the trial version
of ObjectDomain, go into ObjectDomain and open
cvsroot/model/od/memops/Test.odm. Save it as something else before
making changes. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now open 'Logical' in the contents
tree, and go into the _Test-details diagram in the testing.Test
package. This is where you should do your modeling. You will also
have the memops.Implementation package available but you should make
no chages there.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The description here is simplified.
More details are given in 'Advanced Modeling' below. Note that the
generation scripts (see below) will check that your model is valid,
and given mostly sensible error messages to tell you what is wrong.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When you get to generating code from
your model, you should note that Java generation does not work with
the minimum test model. Also, you need to remove all files
cvsroot/python/*/model/*.py, as the model files you download from
SurceForge are ntoe compartible with the minimum test model.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Classes:</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first thing you will need is to
create a class. A valid class needs a number of things done.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All classes must have a superclass
	(set in superclass tab inside popup). The superclass should be
	Implementation.NormalStored by default, or another class that
	inherits from it. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All non-abstract classes must have
	a parent link. The parent must be either another class within the
	same package or Project. Make a link with a filled diamond on the
	parent. The link must be 'Aggregation:Composite, Multiplicity:1,
	Changeable:frozen' on the parent side, and 'Multiplicity:*' on the
	child side.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All Attributes, links, and
	operations in a class share the same namespace and so must have
	different names. This includes inherited attributes etc.</P>
</UL>
<H4 CLASS="western">Attributes: 
</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These are added in the popup of the
class. All attributes must have a name and a Data Type. DataTypes are
set by clicking the three dots button to the right of TypeRef.
'Normal' classes can not be used as Data Types for Attributes. At the
test level you should stick to the data types defined in the model.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Links: 
</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Links are made by connecting two
classes on the diagram. The two ends of a link are edited separately
(set 'Assoc Ends' tab after double clicking on a link). Names need
not be set, as they are set from the names of the connected classes
by default. It is sometimes confusing which end of a link means what.
An example should clarify this. If we look at the link between
Implementation.Url and Implementation.AbstractStorage, the end
connected to Url has the number 1. This means that each
AbstractAStorage has exactly one Url. The other end, marked '*' and
'storages' means that each Url can have any number of storages, and
that the name used for the link is 'storages', not
'abstractStorages'.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Multiplicity:</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This denotes the maximum and minumum
number of values allowed for an attribute or link. If the
multiplicity is not set, it defaults to '0..1' (optional). A single
number (e.g. 1 or 5) means exactly that many (1..1 or 5..5). '*'
means 'as many as you like'. The most common multiplicities are
'0..1', '1', and '*', but you could have any continous range (e.g.
'3..17').</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Changeable:</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Changeable is set to Frozen, this
means the attribute or link must be set when the object is created
and cannot be modified later.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Names:</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Names of functions etc. use singular or
plural as appropriate. For attributes or links that may have more
than one value, the name given should be plural. To give the
singulsar form, the attibute or link should have a Tagged Value, with
the tag being 'baseName' and the value being the singular form of the
name. For links this is only necessary if you give an explicitl name,
as the names are otherwise derived from the class name. You need not
bother about these tagged values if you stick to single values for
attributes and avoid explicit names for links.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Keys:</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each non-abstract class must have one
or more attributes or links specified as keys. These must uniquely
identify the object among other objects of the same type with the
same parent. The key is specified by adding the tagged value
'mainkey' to the class. The value of the tagged value is a
comma-separated list of the names of the attributes and links that
make up the key. All elements of the key must be frozen and have
multiplicity n..n (e.g. 1..1, 2..2). If you have no good candidate
for the key, you should use the serial number. This must be an
attribute called 'serial', DataType 'int', multiplicity '1',
changeable 'frozen. It must furthermore have a tagged Value
'isAutomatic':'True'.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Inheritance:</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The contents of a class is copied down
to the subclass, so they share a namespace. You can only have name
overlap (overwriting) in special cases. The key and parent link are
also inherited and cannot be overwritten. 
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="Advanced Modeling:|outline"></A>Advanced
Modeling:</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When you are modeling for real you need
to consider a few extra things. This is still an abbreviated version,
though. See the header of MetaModel.py for details, or use the
existing model as an example.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Getting started:</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">You should use the full model,
Model.odm for real work, as Test.odm was a minimum version designed
to fit under the 30 class limit of the ObjectDomain test version. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">You could delete some of the existing
packages, but we recomemnd that you simply work in a new one - if you
ever want to link your work to the existing stuff you will have to
anyway. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">You either make a new package in
Logical (similar to 'testing' in Test.odm), or decide to work inside
'ccp' (other packages are erserved for the implementation or for
other groups). You now make a new package for your work inside the
package you have selected. The package must have a Tagged Value
'shortName':'XXXX&rdquo;, where XXXX is an upper case name of no more
than four characters that is not already in use. This name serves as
a package identifier when making e.g. database names.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now you create a class diagram inside
your package (right mouse-&gt;create-&gt;class diagram). You rename
the clas diagram '_&lt;myPackage&gt;-details' , to fit with the
diagram naming convention. You can have several diagrams, but they
should all start with underscore and end with -details. When your
work is stable, you can then make overview diagrams without the
'-details' as has been done for the rest of the model. It will be
easier to put a copy of Project in your diagram, so you can make
parent links to Project. You can get the small version of the class
by using the options under right-mouse-&gt;Presentation Options</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">DataTypes:</H4>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To create a dataType, create a
	class, then set Stereotype to DataType (class popup, class tab, left
	side).<BR>DataTypes do not obey the same rules as Classes.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All Data Types must be subclasses
	of another DataType, inheriting eventuallly from one of the basic
	types (currently Int, Long, Float, Double, Boolean, String). You can
	use DateTime even though it is not implemented yet. It will be at
	some point, but meanwhile it is a subclass of String. At present
	Long and Double are not used, and are implemented like Int and
	Float, respectively, This may change.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">DataTypes can be further specified
	by tagged values. In addition to Constraints (see below) you can set
	the length (string types only). This is the maximum allowed length
	of the string. Also you can set enumeration and isOpen, the latter
	requires the former. This serves to make enumerated data types. The
	enumeration tagged value is a comma-separeated tuple of strings
	(with quotation marks) that gives the allowed values. Note that an
	enumerated set of integers would be given as e.g. ('1','3','5'), the
	fact that they are integers follows from the fact that the datatype
	would inherit from Int. If isOpen is True the enumeration is Open.
	This means that you can use values not in the enumeration, so that
	it is more like a recommended series of values.</P>
</UL>
<H4 CLASS="western">Package import and interpackage links:</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If you make a link between classes in
two diferent packages, you must tell which package imports from
which. The only exception is Implementation, which is imported by
default. The direction of import matters - basically if A imports B
this means that package A knows about package B, and that importing A
will trigger the import of B, whether we are talking about API code
or data. B, on the other hand, knows nothing about A. Clearly new
packages should import old packages, not the other way around. To set
an import, look at the three diagrams in ccp: _Citation, _LIMS, and
_Structural. Put your package on a diagram next to the package it
should imoprt. Draw a dependency arrow (dotted arrow pointing top
right on menu) from importing to imported package. Double-click the
arrow and set stereotype to 'import'. As a graphics convention right
click the arrow, do <BR>Presentation Options-&gt;Stereotype Label:
Off, and do Diagram-&gt;Refresh Diagrams from the top menu. 
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">ContentStored packages:</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Most packages are stored as a single
XML file, but some are stored in several files, like ChemComp and
Coordinates. These are more complicated. A ContentStored packge must
have a HeadObject. This must be a class that is a subclass of
Implementation.ContentStored, and that is a child of Project. The
HeadObject is not part of the ContentStored package. All Classes in
the ContentStored package must be children of either the HeadObject
or an other class in the ContentStored package. It does not matter
for the data loading whether the class with the HeadObject imports
the ContentStored package or the other way around; it will make a
difference for the loading of code.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Constraints:</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">You can constrain your data beyond what
e.g. types and multiplicities can do. This is done by entering code
snippets that are slotted into the generated API code in an
appropriate context. Depending on the situation, the variables 'self'
and 'value' will be defined in context and can be used. Constraints
must either be single lines of code that evaluate to a truth value,
or multiple lines of code that set the parameter isValid to a truth
value. There are three kinds of Constraints</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Constraints on Data Types: These
	can depend only on the 'value' parameter</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Constraints on Attributes and
	Links. These can depend both on 'value' and 'self'. As they are
	evaluated during object creation, you can not, however, count on
	other values in the object being set. The only value that can be
	relied on is the link to the parent, that is always set first. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Constraints on a class. These are
	evaluated only at the end of object creation or when checkValid is
	called explicitly, and so can rely on the object being in a legal
	state.</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Constraints on datatypes, attributes
and links are evaluated before any operation that modifies the
appropriate value, and are thus guaranteed to hold. Constraints on
classes are evaluated only at the end of object creation and file
loading, or when the checkValid function is called explicitly.
Therefore these constraints may be temporarily broken.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">See the header comment to MetaModel for
the precise rules on how to enter Constraints.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Operations:</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Most operations are generated
automatically. After all, the code needed to set or get a text
attribute with a given name can be deduced from the model
description. But, if you want, you can enter custom versions of
autogenerated functions or your own new operations in the model. 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Operations are entered in the
	class that carries them (operation tab).</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To overwrite an autogenerated
	operation just put in one with the same name.</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the operation has no side
	effects (e.g. get, findFirst, findAll), set 'Query' to True.</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All operations must have an opType
	tagged value. Operations that correspond to autogenerated ones can
	have the opTypes 'get', 'set', 'add', 'remove', 'findFirst',
	'findAll'. Other operations must have opType 'other'. You cannot
	overwrite creation, deletion, or factory functions, but you can add
	extra code to them.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Operation parameters must be set
	correctly. A single return parameter must be called 'result', and
	must be of the type (class or datatype) of the value returned. The
	return type is the same whether a single value or a list is
	returned. When overwriting autogenerated functions this is taken
	care of automatically; 'other' functions returning lists or values
	not defined in the model are not possible. A single input parameter
	must be called 'value' - the rules for typing are the same for input
	and return parameters.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Operations must have two tagged
	values 'pythonCode' and 'javaCode' that hold the code to be
	executed. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">See the header comment to MetaModel.py
	for the detailed rules for operations.</P>
</UL>
<H4 CLASS="western">Special Constructor and Destructor code:</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It is possible to enter code that is
added to constructors and destructors.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For constructors
	'hasSpecialConstructor':True signals that there is this kind of
	code. pythonConstructorCode and javaConstructorCode tags contain the
	actual code. Special constructor code is executed after construction
	is finished (so the object is otherwise valid) but before validation
	checking. This code is not executed when isReading is set to True. A
	typical use of this facility would be to automatically create extra
	required objects when several objects must be created together.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For destructor code the relevant
	tags are hasSpecialDestructor, pythonDestructorCode and
	javaDestructorCode. This code is executed at the beginning of the
	delete functions before any deletion has taken place. A typical use
	would be code that preveneted deletion of objects as long as certain
	links are set.</P>
</UL>
<H4 CLASS="western">Derived attributes and links:</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It is possible to enter attributes and
link elements that are never stored but calculated on the fly.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They are entered in the normal
	way, but attributes are given the tagged value 'isDerived':True. For
	links the tagged value 'isDerived':True is given to the
	*association*, not to either of the Association Ends. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For a derived element there must
	be an Operation that explicitly overrides the 'get' function for the
	element. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Normally the derived element is
	set to 'frozen'. If this is not done there must be an Operation that
	explicitly overrides the 'set' function for the element. This
	requires, obviously, that the setter function so modifies the
	underlying stored parameters that you would afterwards get the value
	you had just set. An example might be e.g. a point position that
	could be given as either x,y or r,theta. Here one of the coordinate
	sets (say, Cartesian) could be stored, while the attributes for the
	other one (Polar) could be derived but settable.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If a derivation does not return a
	value the behaviour depends on the multiplicity. For a mandatory
	element you get an error - for an optional one you return None (or
	an empty tuple).</P>
</UL>
<H4 CLASS="western">Automatic attributes and links:</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tagged value 'isAutomatic':True
signifies an attribute that is stored in the normal way, but that
cannot be set because it is set automatically (and discreetly) by the
API, by specialConstructorCode etc.. The main example is the 'serial'
attribute</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Special attributes:</H4>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">serial: serves to provide a key
	for classes that otherwise do not have one. It is described above
	how to define serials. Serials are set automatically when a new
	object is created, and a new value should not be passed in. A new
	serial will be larger than the serial of any similar child of the
	same parent. Serials of deleted objects are not reused, except in
	rare cases if you delete the object with the highest serial, save
	the file and quit. Documentation for serials is entered
	automatically.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">details: documentation is entered
	automatically. The details attribute should be of type Text or
	String. By convention it is used for free text comments, notes, etc.</P>
</UL>
<H4 CLASS="western">One-way links:</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The 'navigable' checkbox in the edit
popup for links (Assoc ends) determines if a link is navigable in a
given direction. In the Model description there will be a MetaRole
only if the link is navigable. In one-way links the object on the
other end does not know there is a link to it. There is no way to
follow the link in the inverse direction, and if the linked-to object
is deleted the link is left dangling. Unless derived, one-way links
should be used only for links to reference data that do not
change(e.g. chemical element descriptions) or where the nature of the
data gives some guarantee that the linked-to object will not be
deleted. 
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Links that are their own inverse:</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It is possible in special circumstances
to make a link from a class to itself where there is only one role.
Examples would be covalently-bound-to (for atoms) of married-to (for
people) where the link and the inverse link are the same. See
MetaModel.py for details.</P>

<H4 CLASS="western">Saving the model to disk:</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When you think the model is ready, you
should save it to disk. Note that the procedure does not remove
previous model files, so if you remove or rename packages you must
remove the old model files and all related autogenerated code by
hand. You go into the Python Shell in ObjectDomain and type the
following:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">from memops.scripts import
ObjectDomain<BR>from memops.scripts import PyModelIO<BR>mm =
ObjectDomain.modelFromOd()<BR>PyModelIO.writePythonCode(mm)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first two lines need only be done
the first time. Once you get to the fourth line things are OK and you
can quit ObjectDomain and go on to the next step.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The third line is where the model
Python objects are generated and the validity checking is done. <BR>If
an error happens at this stage, you have made a mistake in entering
the model and should go and fix it. This always happens a few times.
The validity checking is very thorough. If you get a 'style warning'
you have not followed the normal guidelines for model object names.
We recommend that you fix these too.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Generating code:</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The python/memops/scripts/makePython.py
file is a make script that will generate all python-related files. Go
to whatever directory you like, and type</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">python &lt;path-to-file&gt;/makePython.py</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If you get any errors, there is
presumably an error in your model, which you should try to fix, but
this should happen only rarely.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">You will get a lot of warning messages:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">WARNING, &lt;modelelement&gt; &lt;full
name&gt; has no documentation<BR>is given for every model element
with no documentation. This is to nag you to document your model</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">WARNING: File
'/home/rhf22/CCPN/cvsroot/model/doc//html/diagram/ccp_Crystallography__Crystallography_Diag.gif'
does not exist<BR>tells you either that you do not have all the
diagrams with the correct name (pairs named _XXX and _XXX-details)
for the diagram-xml generator, or that you have not yet written the
diagrams from ObjectDomain to the correct location. Ignore it - you
only need these things done when you want to use the machinery for
making releases.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The last thing the script does is to
import all python files in cvsroot/python and its subdirectories, in
order to check for errors (note that you should avoid files that
actually do things when imported, because of this). For each import
error, you will get a message like e.g.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">WARNING, Import failed for
ccpnmr.analysis.AnalysisPopup</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">You should check what is actually wrong
by typing 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">python ccpnmr/analysis/AnalysisPopup.py</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This will show you the actual error
message. If there is an error in any file that has to do with your
model, you most likely have an error in one of the code snippets you
added (constraints or methods). This should be fixed. If the errors
only concern code that you do not recognise there may be no cause for
alarm. You can have errors at this stage for a number of reasons: A
file may depend on a c-coded module that you have not compiled.;
There may be checked-in scripts that only work in a particular
environment, like personalised make scripts for the developers or
like the scripts that create the original ChemComp reference data; A
modified file may not work pending the check-in of another modified
file (this is a live repository, it changes all the time); There may
be an error in someone elses code. If you find any errors that do not
have an obvious explanation please let us know.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If you are using the minimum test model
(Test.odm), remember you need to remove all the python/*/model/*.py
files before you start generating the model. Also, you will get a lot
of warnings. A lot of the existing code in the repository will not
work with the minimum model, and it would be dangerous to change the
code just to adapt to a quick0-test code. In this situation you
should ignore:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Any warnings about files in ccp.gui,
ccp.format, ccpnmr.format, memops.editor, ccp.util.Molecule,
memops.scripts.JavaApiGen, memops.scripts.JavaXmlGen,
memops.scripts.SqlSchemaGen, memops.scripts.makeModel as well as
WARNING directory /home/rhf22/CCPN/testroot/python/ccp/model lacks
file '__init__.py' or the same warning for ccpnmr/model.</P>

<H4 CLASS="western">Data Model Versions:</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There is a version number for the entire data model. 
It is defined in the variable memops.general.Constants.currentModelVersion. 
This version is updated by hand. It should be updated before every new release if the
model has changed, and every time the data backwards compatibility code is changed.
In internal development it may be left unchanged even though the model changes.</P>
