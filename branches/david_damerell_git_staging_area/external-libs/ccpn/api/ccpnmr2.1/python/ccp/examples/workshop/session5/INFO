# Part 1: Resonance to atom link
#
# While doing exercise, put slide on illustrating connections!

# Mention that code available to look up information about resonances->atoms, and vice versa...
# Getting this info out is complicated...

# Part2: Nmr measurements
#
# Put slide with info from model up during this!
