#summary How _you_ can contribute to making eurocarb better

=How you can help=

Just using [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/eurocarb the public version of the software online] is a good start, however active contribution of structures, data or even code is highly encouraged. Eurocarb is a long-term, publically accessible data- and knowledge-base, and there are many avenues for improvement, both scientifically in terms of content, and on the IT side in terms of new features, fixes and usability enhancements. If you are interested in contributing to or influencing the direction of the project we highly recommend joining one or more of the following group mailing lists.
