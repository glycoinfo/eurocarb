CCPN Data Model API 1.0 installation notes

The CCPN Data Model API 1.0 release includes all source
code required, including third-party code.

The only third-party application required is Python 2.2.
Users who want to use their own copies of this code can do so.
The API will not work with Python < 2.2 but also works with
Python 2.3 (we have not tried Python 2.4 yet).

To install the code go into the ccpnmr directory (the top-level
directory of the distribution) and run the installCode.py script:
 
  python installCode.py api
 
This assumes that your computer has a working version of Python.
Any version >= 1.5 should work to run the script, but you need
version >= 2.2 for the code itself to run.
The script will ask whether you want to compile Python (2.2), and
if not where your version of Python (>= 2.2) is located.
The script will then create a "bin" directory.

*********Start of Interlude***************************************
 
Alternatively, if for some reason the script does not work, below is
what you need to do to install the code (CCPNMR_TOP_DIR is the ccpnmr
directory created by the unpacking of the tar file):

(1) If you need our version of Python:
      cd $CCPNMR_TOP_DIR/python2.2
    Unpack tar file:
      tar xvzf Python-2.2.3.tgz
      (or "gunzip" followed by "tar xvf" if your tar does not understand "z")
    Compile code:
      cd Python-2.2.3
      ./configure --prefix=$CCPNMR_TOP_DIR/python2.2
      make
      make install
 
*********End of Interlude*****************************************

After successful installation of the code the following environment
variables also need setting or updating (for example, in .cshrc):

  CCPNMR_TOP_DIR must be set to the ccpnmr directory created by the
    unpacking of the tar file
  PYTHONPATH must include $CCPNMR_TOP_DIR/ccpnmr1.0/python
  PATH must include $CCPNMR_TOP_DIR/bin

For example, in .cshrc you could place:

  setenv CCPNMR_TOP_DIR directory_where_you_unpacked_release/ccpnmr
  setenv PATH ${CCPNMR_TOP_DIR}/bin:${PATH}
  setenv PYTHONPATH .:${CCPNMR_TOP_DIR}/ccpnmr1.0/python

Your PATH and PYTHONPATH might need to include other things:  to
illustrate this the example of PATH above includes other directories
previously defined to be in PATH (the above line will fail if PATH
has not been previously defined, which it normally is).
