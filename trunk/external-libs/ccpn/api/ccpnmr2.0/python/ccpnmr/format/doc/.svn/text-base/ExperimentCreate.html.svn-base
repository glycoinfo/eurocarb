        <P ALIGN="LEFT">This window allows you to create an experiment (and all its associated dimensions)
        within the Data Model. An experiment has to be present in the Data Model before, for example, a
        peak list can be created, as the peak dimensions are linked to the (reference) dimensions
        of the experiment.</P>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">First select the appropriate experiment type from the selection list. Within the
        data model the reference experiments are organised according to magnetization pathway. The
        selection table shows the common name for this pathway, the 'official' name of the experiment, its
        dimensionality, the 'official' name of the pathway and the type of pathway.</P>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">Note that multiple experiments are possible within the same pathway. Within the
        'official' experiment or pathway name, right brackets [] indicate 'in-out' magnetization, curly
        brackets {} indicate multiple nuclei within the same pathway step, and underscores _ indicate the
        type of transfer (which is listed at the end of the name).</P>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">Only experiment types with the relevant dimensionality will be listed in the
        experiment types list. Click the <B>Show all experiments</B> button to show experiments of all
        dimensionalities.</P>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">Press <B>Skip</B> to skip creation of the experiment (and anything else linked to
        it like peak lists or acquisition parameters)</P>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">After you click 'Create' you will be asked to give a name to the experiment. If an
        experiment name was already available from an imported file, it should be displayed here.</P>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">If the required experiment type is not available then it can be created via the
        '<I>Setup:Edit default experiment types</I>' menu option.</P>
