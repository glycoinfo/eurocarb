        <P ALIGN="LEFT">The atom names from the external files can only be handled correctly if the
        chain/residue information from the external files is correctly mapped to the chain/residue information
        inside the Data Model. For example, some external formats cannot handle multiple chains, and use
        different sequence codes to distinguish between them (e.g. the first chain starts at 1, the second at
        300). These codes then have to be mapped to the chains inside the Data Model.</P>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">This window, then, allows you to link the <I>Data Model chains and residues</I> to the
        <I>chains and residue information from the external file(s)</I>.</P>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">The chains that are part of the selected molecular system inside the Data Model are
        displayed on the left (under '<B>Data model</B>', <FONT COLOR=0000ff>in blue</FONT>). The '<B>Ccp chain
        code</B>' column lists the chain code, the number of residues in the chain and the name of the molecule
        it represents. The '<B>Sequence ID (code) start</B>' column lists the sequence ID (which invariably
        starts at 1) and, in brackets, the current sequence (plus sequence insertion) code (which can start at
        any number).</P>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">On the right (in black, under '<B>Information from file</B>') the information from the
        external data files is displayed. From '<B>Format chain code</B>' you can select the chain codes and
        sequence code ranges that were detected in the external data files (<I>note that ' ' is the default
        used if no chain code is present in the imported data files</I>). Once you select here, the relevant
        residue sequence codes will be listed under 'Sequence Code start'. If more than one sequence insertion
        code was found within the same format chain code (e.g. both '1' and '1A' as sequence codes), then you
        will also be able to select only residues with a specific insertion code.</P>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">Now select the 'Format chain code' relevant for the appropriate chain in the data
        model. Select the <I>first</I> sequence code from the external file that is also present in the data
        model chain, then select the corresponding sequence ID/code for the Data Model chain. If there are
        sequence codes listed under 'Sequence Code start' that you do NOT want to link, then select them and
        press '<B>Remove</B>'.</P>
        <P>Warnings will appear on the right hand side if there are multiple sequence insertion codes present
        for the same format chain, or when there are 'gaps' in the sequence (e.g. numbering jumps from 6 to
        12). In this case the 'gaps' will be automatically filled in when matching to the sequence in the Data
        Model. <B>If you do not want this to happen, remove the unwanted sequence numbers, run linkResonances,
        and rerun it afterwards to link the second set of sequence codes</B></P>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">Press '<B>OK</B>' to continue when you have linked the information from the external
        files to the chains in the Data Model.</P>
