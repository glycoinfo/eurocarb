        <P ALIGN="LEFT">Here you determine how the chains from the Data Model are written out to the external
        format. For external formats that do not support chain codes (and if you have more than one chain), you
        will have to select sequence codes so that there is no sequence code overlap between the different chains.
        For external formats that do support chain codes, you can also select a chain code different from the one
        used in the Data Model.</P>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">On the left ('<B>Data model</B>', <FONT COLOR=0000ff>in blue</FONT>) is the information
        from the chains in the Data Model. The '<B>Ccp chain code</B>' gives the chain code, number of residues
        and the name of the molecule this chain represents. Under '<B>Sequence ID (code)</B>', the '<B>start</B>'
        ID of the chain (always 1) and the '<B>end</B>' ID of the chain, and (in brackets) their respective
        sequence codes are listed.</P>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">On the right ('<B>Export</B>') the export information for this chain can be set. If the
        export format supports <B>chain codes</B> it is possible to define your own chain code (the name of the
        chain code depends on the export format). Leave this field blank if you do not want to use a chain code.
        In the '<B>Sequence code start</B>' field, you set the sequence code that will be used for the residue
        with Sequence ID 1 in the external format.</P>
