            <H2>Creating an Entry for deposition.
        </H2>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">In this window you can create an 'Entry' object. An Entry groups data
        from your project together for archiving purposes. For example, if you want to deposit
        your coordinate and NMR information via the MSD website, or if you want to create an
        NMR-STAR file, you should create an Entry that groups together all the final data in
        your project. You can then send your CCPN XML files to the E-MSD deposition site, where
        all the relevant information will be extracted, and you will then have the option to
        further your NMR information on to the BioMagResBank for deposition there.</P>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>NOTE: Deposition via the <a
        href="www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/autodep4/index.jsp">MSD</a> is not yet working. It should be
        functional by the end of 2005!</b></P>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">You can have multiple entries that you can select from the 'Pick entry'
        list. To create a new Entry, click the 'Create New' button at the bottom of the page.
        'Delete current' will delete the currently selected Entry, 'Update current' will update
        the window values, and 'Close' will close this window.</P>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">A Study connects multiple entries together (e.g. if you have a project
        that contains information on both the free and ligand-bound protein, you can create
        different Entries for them and group them under the same Study.). To create a new Study,
        click the 'Edit/new Study' button.</P>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">You should also enter information on the people and laboratories
        involved in the project (this will be automatically used during deposition). Using the
        'Select contactPersons', 'Select authors' and 'Select laboratories' options. Create new
        persons/labs or edit existing ones with the 'Edit/new' buttons. Note that <b>only</b>
        the selected (grey highlighted) persons/labs are the ones currently connected to this
        Entry!</P>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">Next, select the MolSystem (molecular system) in your project that is
        relevant for this Entry. You can add information on the journal, book, thesis or
        conference citations connected to the currently selected MolSystem using 'Select
        citations'. Create new citations or edit existing ones with the 'Edit/new' buttons.
        Note that <b>only</b> the selected (grey highlighted) citations are the ones currently
        connected to this Entry!</P>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">Finally, you can select all the relevant Experiments, Structure
        Generations, and Measurement and Derived Data List that you want to connect to this
        Entry.</P>
