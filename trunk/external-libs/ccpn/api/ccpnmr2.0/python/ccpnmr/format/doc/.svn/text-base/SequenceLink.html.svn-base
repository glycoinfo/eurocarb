            <H2>Import original sequence</H2>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">This window allows you to do a full interpretation of the sequence that was read in for
        a data format file, so that it can be imported into the Data Model correctly.</P>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">On the left (under '<B>Original import</B>) the original sequence(s) that were read in
        are displayed. You can click on this sequence to remove sequence elements or to move them to other
        molecules. You can also set particular chemCompVars (e.g. protonated ARG) from here.</P>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">On the right (under '<B>Data model</B>', in blue) the information that will be used
        inside the Data Model is displayed. The '<B>Molecular type</B>' depends on the sequence elements that
        were found. Current valid molecular types are 'protein', 'DNA', and 'RNA' for pure linear biopolymers,
        and 'other' for everything else. Clicking on '<B>Molecule name</B>' allows you to set your own name for
        the molecule that will be created (this option is not available if the molecule is already present
        inside the Data Model). You can set the '<B>Number of chains</B>' to determine the number of chains that
        will be created for this molecule inside the molecular system (e.g. set this to 2 for a homodimer). This
        number can also be set to '0' if you only want to create a molecule, and no molecular system with
        chains.</P>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">Finally, warning messages can appear in red on the right hand side. This occurs when
        sequence elements could not be automatically recognized and have to be identified by the user. If they
        are not identified, they will be ignored when the molecule is created!</P>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">Press '<B>OK</B>' to continue after you have set everything correctly. Press '<B>Reset
        to original</B>' if you want to return the window to its original state. Press '<B>Cancel</B>' to use
        the automatically set options.</P>
