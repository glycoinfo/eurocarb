        <P ALIGN="LEFT">This window allows you to select objects in the Data Model and export them to the chosen
        external format. Press the '<B>i</B>' button on the right hand side to get concise information about the
        selections/buttons.</P>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">To export a particular file (e.g. a <I>peak list</I>), select the relevant Data Model
        object (e.g. a <I>peakList</I>) from the '<B>Select ... to export</B>' selection list. This selection list
        can allow either single or multi selection depending on the format and the component. Then select the file
        to export to by pressing '<B>Select export file</B>', and press the '<B>export ...</B> button to export
        the file.</P>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">You can also click on the '<B>Additional options</B>' blue arrow to obtain more
        (non-essential) options for export. Common options are:</P>
        <UL>
        <LI>'<B>Use original resonance names</B>': If selected, the originally imported resonance (atom) names
            will be exported instead of the names that were selected for this particular format. <I><B>Caution</B>:
            if changes were made to the resonances in the Data Model this can result in errors in the output,
            since the originally imported names are never changed (it would be impossible to know how and when).
            Also, if the chosen format only allows a particular type of naming system the originally imported
            names will not be used.</I>
        <LI>'<B>Compress names in output</B>' If available and selected, the atom names will be 'compressed' in
            the output. For constraints, this means that constraint items will be regrouped into atom sets (e.g. a
            constraint with items HA-HB1, HA-HB2 becomes HA-HB*), for measurements this means that atoms with
            exactly the same measurement value and with a shared atom set are grouped (e.g. if in a shift list HB2
            and HB3 have shift 2.74, it will be written out as HB* with shift 2.74. This also works for isopropyl
            methyl groups).
