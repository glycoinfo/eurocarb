      <H2>1. Opening a CCPN project</H2>
      <P>
      Start Analysis at the command line:
      </P>
      <PRE>-> analysis</PRE>
      <P>
      Once the main Analysis popup has appeared and the
      menus are active select <SPAN CLASS='item'>M:Project:New</SPAN>&nbsp;
      Enter a project name (<SPAN CLASS='item'>"TutorialProject"</SPAN> - or similar without spaces) into the dialogue box and
      click <SPAN CLASS='item'>[OK]</SPAN>&nbsp;.
      </P>
      <P>
      Existing projects may me opened from within Analysis at the expense of any extant current project.
      Alternatively, a project file name may be passed as a command line argument when Analysis is started:
      <PRE">-> analysis TutorialProject.xml</PRE>
      </P>
      <P>
      Once a project has been created many options within the main Analysis menu become active.
      The project can now be saved (<SPAN CLASS='item'>M:Project:Save</SPAN>&nbsp;)
      and the automated backup facility may be configured (<SPAN CLASS='item'>M:Project:Backup</SPAN>&nbsp;).
      </P>
      <P>
      The first time you save project a popup window will appear. Here you have the opportunity to modify the
      locations at which the various XML data files will be stored. The next time the project is saved it will
      use the locations that you initially set and will save without you having to specify anything. However, the
      storage locations may be modified at any time in the future using the Save As option -
      <SPAN CLASS='item'>M:Project:Save As.</SPAN>
      </P>
      <P>
      Have a look in the Save Project popup. You will see three blue arrows on the left. Click on each of these to
      open up the various tables of storage information, then increase the size of the window (grab the edges) so
      that you can see all of the columns. The top <SPAN CLASS='item'>Urls</SPAN> table shows you all of the
      directories in which data is stored. For this new project you will see that there is one directory for the
      project (where you are working at the moment), one data directory inside this with the same name as the
      project and two data directories for reference information (in this case chemical element and
      reference experiment data) located
      amongst the CCPN software files. If you were to move your project files or the reference data you may have
      to update the various locations (although Analysis will prompt you if it can't find something).
      </P>
      <P>
      Looking now at the middle <SPAN CLASS='item'>Storages</SPAN> table you
      will see that various XML files and which of the above URL directories they residue in. You can see that 
      the project XML file is saved at the first URL. Analysis.xml, Method.xml, and Nmr.xml are saved in
      subdirectories at the second URL. The chemElement.xml file, which as reference data is not modifiable, is
      stored at the last URL directory. As your project grows, for example with molecules, NMR constraints, structures and
      such like, other storage locations will automatically appear in this table.
      </P>
      <P>
      The lower <SPAN CLASS='item'>Data locations</SPAN> table, although currently empty, will display the
      locations (URL and file name) of any spectrum files you are using in the project. After spectra have been
      loaded you may like to look at the entries which appear in the table. If you move your data you may need to
      edit this table.
      </P>
      <P>
      In the Save Project popup lick on <SPAN CLASS='item'>[Save]</SPAN> and then click
      <SPAN CLASS='item'>[Yes]</SPAN> when you are prompted about making a new data directory.
      You should now  <SPAN CLASS='item'>[Close]</SPAN> the popup.
      </P>
      <H2>2. Setup HSQC spectrum</H2>
      <H3>Open HSQC spectrum</H3>
      <P>
      Select <SPAN CLASS='item'>M:Experiment:Open Spectra</SPAN>&nbsp; to bring up the Open Spectrum popup.
      Looking in the initial directory, you will see that the displayed files are 
      restricted to Azara parameter files (<SPAN
      CLASS='item'>P:File Format:Azara (*.par)</SPAN>&nbsp;is selected). Select file <SPAN
      CLASS='item'>5.spc.par</SPAN>&nbsp;, fill in the experiment and spectrum name in the lower table.
      If you double click in the element of a table that has a small <SPAN CLASS='item'>E</SPAN> in its 
      lower left corner you will be able to edit the value. Do this on the table cell that contains
      <SPAN CLASS='item'>Expt_1</SPAN>.
      </P>
      <P>
      Experiment name is often indicative of the experiment type, so <SPAN CLASS='item'>HSQC</SPAN>&nbsp; will do here
      for our purposes. Click on the table, somewhere outside the newly edited experiment name, to set it.
      The spectrum name can be set is a similar manner. The spectrum name may be something simple like <SPAN
      CLASS='item'>"a"</SPAN>&nbsp;, but it is common to give a file reference number (<SPAN
      CLASS='item'>"5"</SPAN>&nbsp; here) to remind you of the data file you're using.
      </P>
      <P>
      You will notice that there is one more editable column in the lower table, for Shift List. Although
      you will not need to alter shift lists for this tutorial (the Data Analysis tutorial will use it) it
      is an important point to consider when loading spectra. Different shift lists may be set for 
      different experiments if, because they are performed under distinct conditions, they have different
      chemical shifts for the same atoms. In this way, the variation in chemical shift which arises from
      experimental differences won't affect the standard deviation of the shifts. Experiments under the same
      conditions are all assigned within the scope their shift list.
      </P>
      <P>
      With the experiment and spectrum names set, click <SPAN CLASS="item">[Open Spectra]</SPAN>&nbsp;.
      Two modal popup windows will appear sequentially. Each give an opportunity to modify the parameter
      information that was contained within the parameter file. For the first popup set <SPAN CLASS='item'>Is
      data big endian</SPAN>&nbsp; to ON (so that the button is red). All the remaining parameter information is
      correct for the demo, so just click <SPAN CLASS='item'>[OK]</SPAN>&nbsp; on this and again on the
      subsequent popup.
      </P>
      <P>
      In the third popup we are given the opportunity to specify the type of NMR experiment that was performed.
      In the <SPAN CLASS='item'>Full Type</SPAN>.column doubel click on the table cell corresponding to the HSQC
      and select the <SPAN CLASS='item'>H[N]</SPAN> option. You will notice that this fills on the other columns of
      the table. Alternatively you could set the <SPAN CLASS='item'>Category</SPAN> to
      <SPAN CLASS='item'>through-bond</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS='item'>Type Synonym</SPAN> to
      <SPAN CLASS='item'>15N HSQC/HMQC</SPAN> to restrict the possibilites before setting the type. When done
      click on <SPAN CLASS='item'>[Close]</SPAN> to continue.
      </P>
      <P>
      After a few moments a spectrum window to display the spectrum will automatically be created.
      A window is only automatically created in projects that do not already have an existing one that
      is suitable. Once the
      spectrum is loaded some contours will be visible in this window. Click <SPAN
      CLASS='item'>[Close]</SPAN>&nbsp; on the Open Spectrum popup (possibly behind the spectrum window)
      as it will not be needed for a while.
      You will notice that, because of the contrasting number of data points in the two experimental
      dimensions, the contours appear stretched. To address this we need to alter the aspect ratio of this
      window (<SPAN CLASS='item'>window1</SPAN>&nbsp;). Thus, select <SPAN CLASS='item'>M:Window:Edit
      Window</SPAN>&nbsp; and in the resulting popup double click on the <SPAN
      CLASS='item'>1.00</SPAN>&nbsp; figure in the Aspect Ratio column of the table. Enter an aspect ratio
      of 8 and hit <SPAN CLASS='item'>&lt;Return&gt;</SPAN>&nbsp;. Return to <SPAN
      CLASS='item'>Window1</SPAN>&nbsp; and zoom in (<SPAN CLASS='item'>&lt;PgDn&gt;</SPAN>&nbsp;) to view
      the contours in detail.
      </P>
      <H3>Setup spectrum contours</H3>
      <P>
      Next the spectrum needs to have its contour levels adjusted. At the top of <SPAN
      CLASS='item'>Window1</SPAN>&nbsp; click on the blue triangle next to <SPAN
      CLASS='item'>Contours</SPAN>&nbsp;. This will provide some contouring options at the top of the
      window. Select <SPAN CLASS='item'>[Detailed Settings]</SPAN>&nbsp;. Note that this is equivalent to
      selecting <SPAN CLASS='item'>M:Experiment:Edit Spectra</SPAN>&nbsp; and clicking
      <SPAN CLASS='item'>[Contour levels]</SPAN>.
      </P>
      <P>
      In the contour level popup turn
      off <SPAN CLASS='item'>negative contours</SPAN>&nbsp;and set the <SPAN
      CLASS='item'>Base level[]</SPAN>&nbsp; to 0.5 and press <SPAN CLASS='item'>&lt;Return&gt;</SPAN>.
      You will see contour display change in <SPAN
      CLASS='item'>window1</SPAN>&nbsp; to reflect these new settings. Click <SPAN
      CLASS="item">[Done]</SPAN>&nbsp; to remove the contour popup.
      </P>
      <P>
      To change the contour colours select <SPAN CLASS='item'>M:Experiment:Edit
      Spectra</SPAN>&nbsp;. In the Edit Spectrum popup double click on the <SPAN CLASS='item'>Pos.
      contour colours</SPAN>&nbsp; entry and select a new colour (or colour scheme) from the
      pull-down menu. Also, you may double click to edit any of the parameters in the table (if
      there is a small <SPAN CLASS='item'>"E"</SPAN>&nbsp; in the lower left of a table cell). You
      will notice that once a parameter is changed (like contour colour) all of the other parts of
      the Analysis program that refer to the same parameter are automatically notified and the
      screen is updated accordingly.
      </P>
      <H3>Pick crosspeaks</H3>
      <P>
      To pick crosspeaks for our freshly loaded HSQC spectrum use the left mouse button while holding down the <SPAN
      CLASS="item">&lt;Shift&gt;</SPAN>&nbsp; and <SPAN CLASS='item'>&lt;Control&gt;</SPAN>&nbsp;. The <SPAN
      CLASS="item">&lt;Shift&gt;</SPAN>&nbsp; key acts as a modifier to allow you to drag a box over the contours. <SPAN
      CLASS="item">&lt;Control&gt;</SPAN>&nbsp; instructs Analysis to pick new crosspeaks in the boxed region, without it
      the mouse will just select existing crosspeaks. Pick the whole spectrum by dragging boxes over regions of the
      spectrum devoid of noise and
      artefacts.
      </P>
      <P>
      Any dubious or incorrectly aliased peaks may be deleted by using <SPAN
      CLASS='item'>&lt;Del&gt;</SPAN>&nbsp; or selecting <SPAN CLASS='item'>R:Peak:Delete selected
      peaks</SPAN>&nbsp; at any time. Try this out by picking and deleting an artefact, but be
      careful make sure that this is the only selected peak: Click on a blank patch of the spectrum,
      and then drag a box (left click and + <SPAN CLASS='item'>&lt;Shift&gt;</SPAN>) over the desired peak. You can view which peaks
      are selected at any time, even if they are not immediately visible within the windows, by
      selecting <SPAN CLASS='item'>R:Peak:Selected peaks...</SPAN>&nbsp;.
      </P>
      <H3>Assign resonances</H3>
      <P>
      Next we will assign one of the peaks in a rather basic and anonymous manner. We will
      assign a 15N and a 1H resonance to an HSQC peak, appropriate to its experimental
      dimensions, and then group these resonances together into an unnamed spin system.
      </P>
      <P>
      For the next part we will focus upon the peak at 1H,15N ppms 7.12,119.5, as it is one
      that we will refer to later. While holding the mouse cursor over the HSQC peak select
      <SPAN CLASS='item'>R:Assign:Assign peak</SPAN>&nbsp; with the right mouse button. If this
      option is not available, zoom in on the peak and try again at a portion closer to the
      centre of the peak. When the option is selected the Edit Assignment popup will appear.
      Alternatively you can press the <SPAN CLASS='item'>"a"</SPAN> key when the mouse cursor
      is over the peak.
      </P>
      <P>a
      Along the left of this are columns representing the 1H and 15N dimensions of the peak,
      and on the right, in line with each dimension, are lists of resonances to which the
      peak may be assigned. As this is a new project there are currently no resonances
      present, so for each of the dimensions click anywhere on the line beginning <SPAN
      CLASS='item'>"New"</SPAN>&nbsp;. This will assign a new resonance to both of the peaks
      dimensions. You will note that the contribution of these resonances to the peak
      dimensions with the <SPAN CLASS='item'>[1]</SPAN>&nbsp; and <SPAN
      CLASS='item'>[2]</SPAN>&nbsp; labels. Each peak dimension has a list associated with
      it because it can potentially point to several resonances, as is often found for
      unresolved prochiral hydrogens; e.g. where HB2 and HB3 resonances cannot be
      distinguished. Note that once you have made the assignment, the annotation of the peak
      in the spectrum window changes to reflect its new connectivity; to the new resonances
      <SPAN CLASS='item'>[1]</SPAN>&nbsp; and <SPAN CLASS='item'>[2]</SPAN>&nbsp;.
      </P>
      <P>
      Next we will group these newly assigned resonances into a spin system. Close the
      distracting Edit Assignment popup and select the newly assigned peak (left click so
      that it has a square box around it) then
      select <SPAN CLASS='item'>R:Assign:Add to spin system</SPAN>&nbsp; from the right mouse
      menu. You will now notice that the peak annotation has been prepended with <SPAN
      CLASS='item'>{1}</SPAN>&nbsp; to indicate the resonances have been grouped into spin
      system 1. Note that the actual residue assignment can readily be assigned, or even
      reassigned, at a later point, so the spin system numbering at the moment is just for
      bookkeeping.
      </P>
      <H3>Run an initialisation macro</H3>
      <P>
      Initially we made resonance and spin system assignments by manually performing each of
      the required steps. However, to save time and avoid performing repetitive, brainless
      tasks several assignment macros have been written. With one of these we will repeat
      the same type of anonymous assignments we made for the first HSQC peak for all of the
      peaks in the spectrum.
      </P>
      <P>
      Firstly we will put the macro in the main menu. Select 
      <SPAN CLASS='item'>M:Macros:Edit Macros</SPAN> and then in the macros popup double click
      on the <SPAN CLASS='item'>In main menu</SPAN> for the <SPAN CLASS='item'>initialiseHSQC</SPAN>
      macro (top line) so that the value becomes <SPAN CLASS='item'>Yes</SPAN>. 
      To run the assignment macro just select <SPAN
      CLASS='item'>M:Macros:initialiseHSQC</SPAN>&nbsp; from the main menu. 
      As there is
      currently only one spectrum in the project no further information has to be passed in.
      However, if there were multiple spectra, we would have to say which we wanted to
      perform the macro operation upon. Once the macro has run you will see that all of the
      peaks will carry new resonance assignments and that these are grouped into spin
      systems, one for each peak. If you select <SPAN CLASS='item'>M:Assignment:Spin
      systems</SPAN>&nbsp; you can see all of these groupings. Note that as the macro acts
      blindly on all the peaks the various side chain HN peaks have been initially put into
      distinct spin systems. Once we can connect side chain peaks to each of their atoms or to
      resonances it is a simple matter to merge spin systems together.
      </P>
      <P>
      The HSQC spectrum is now assigned anonymously to a degree that will serve as a basis
      for the sequential assignment. Because all of the backbone amide 1H and 15N resonances
      now exist, when we come to connect side chain resonances we will simply select the
      appropriate pre-existing spin system for joining.
      </P>
      <H2>3. Setup molecular system</H2>
      <P>
      To provide full, atomic level assignments we need to input the protein sequence into
      Analysis. This is done by the creation of a molecular system. The molecular system
      represents all the assignable molecules that may reside within the NMR sample, these
      include proteins, nucleic acids and small molecules. For this tutorial we
      make a mock molecular system with one protein chain and one small
      molecule.
      </P>
      <P>
      Open <SPAN CLASS='item'>M:Molecules:Molecular Systems</SPAN>&nbsp; and click <SPAN
      CLASS='item'>[Add Mol System]</SPAN>&nbsp;. This will create new blank molecular
      system to which we can add our protein chain (albeit only part for this tutorial).
      Click on the <SPAN CLASS='item'>MS1</SPAN>&nbsp; line to activate the lower section of
      the popup, then click <SPAN CLASS='item'>[Edit Molecule Templates]</SPAN>&nbsp;.
      </P>
      <P>
      The popup which now appears allows you to create a molecule template which you can
      then use to create polymer chains within a molecular system. Such molecule templates
      determine the sequence information to make the residues of the chain. From here select
      <SPAN CLASS='item'>[Add New Molecule]</SPAN>&nbsp;. You will then be prompted for the
      template name. Here you can either accept the default or enter a new name, then click
      <SPAN CLASS='item'>[OK]</SPAN>&nbsp;.
      </P>
      <P>
      Now we will add a sequence to the new molecule template. So select the row in the top
      table containing the new molecule then click on <SPAN CLASS='item'>[Add Polymer
      Residues]</SPAN>&nbsp; in the middle section.
      The next popup provides an input box for macromolecular sequences. First ensure <SPAN
      CLASS='item'>[] Three Letter Codes</SPAN>&nbsp;, is selected, then cut and paste the
      following sequence (left mouse to select in the browser and middle mouse to paste)
      into the text window:
      </P>
      <P>
      <SPAN CLASS='item'>
      LYS ALA SER SER PRO SER SER LEU THR TYR
      LYS GLU MET ILE LEU LYS SER MET PRO GLN
      LEU ASN ASP GLY LYS GLY SER SER ARG ILE
      VAL LEU LYS LYS TYR VAL LYS ASP THR TYR
      </SPAN>&nbsp;
      </P>
      <P>
      The input sequence does not have to be perfectly formatted. You can click <SPAN
      CLASS='item'>[Tidy]</SPAN>&nbsp; at any time to see what Analysis has interpreted as
      the sequence. Also, you can switch between one- and three-letter codes after the
      sequences has been entered. If you look in the <SPAN CLASS='item'>P:Ccp Codes</SPAN>
      pull-down menu you will see all of the residue codes that are currently available, many
      of which are modified amino acids.
      </P>
      <P>
      Once the sequence has been entered, click <SPAN
      CLASS='item'>[OK]</SPAN>&nbsp;. The molecular with all its associated atoms, bonds
      etc. will take a short time to build. When it is done the new molecule will appear in
      the Molecule Templates popup. Note that for new templates you can double click on the
      residues in the table to change them. Try this for a LYS to set its Descriptor to
      indicate a different protonation state.
      </P>
      <P>
      Just for fun, we will now add a small molecule to our project. This could be part of
      the first molecule we made, i.e. linked to the protein in some way. However, here we
      will make a new molecule with <SPAN CLASS='item'>[Add New Molecule]</SPAN> and after
      accepting the name click  <SPAN CLASS='item'>[Add Other Compound]</SPAN>. The Select
      Small Molecule popup will open. Here choose <SPAN CLASS='item'>[Protein]</SPAN> at the
      top then in the right hand table select a compound, perhaps and unusual amino acid, to
      display an idealised structure in the left hand panel. You can rotate the cartoon
      compound by clicking and dragging with the middle mouse button. Using  <SPAN
      CLASS='item'>&lt;Shift&gt;</SPAN> while dragging up and down with the middle mouse
      button will change the zoom level.
      </P>
      <P>
      With any compound selected click <SPAN CLASS='item'>[OK]</SPAN> to enter it into your
      second molecule template.
      Now <SPAN CLASS='item'>[Close]</SPAN>&nbsp;the Molecule Templates popup.
      The templates with the sequence and compound you just entered
      will now be available form the Edit Molecular Systems popup.
      </P>
      <P>
      Returning to the Edit Molecular Systems popup you will see the name of your newly
      created sequence template is displayed at the bottom of the central panel. Now click
      on <SPAN CLASS='item'>[Make chain from template:]</SPAN>&nbsp; just to the left of the
      template name. You will be prompted about whether aromatic atom sets are equivalent due
      to rotation - just click <SPAN CLASS='item'>[Yes]</SPAN>.
      Analysis will now build a polymer chain within the molecular system with a
      sequence derived from the template. This chain contains the residues and atoms that
      you can assign crosspeaks to in the spectra.
      </P>
      <P>
      To view the new polymer chain have a look at <SPAN CLASS='item'>M:Molecules:Atom
      Browser</SPAN>&nbsp;. You can scroll through the sequence and by toggling the <SPAN
      CLASS='item'>[H]</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS='item'>[N]</SPAN>&nbsp; etc. you can display all
      of the assignable sets of atoms.
      </P>
      <H2>4. Setup 3D spectra</H2>
      <P>
      In this part of the tutorial we will load some three dimensional spectra, connect
      their peaks to the HSQC spectrum that we've already set up and then assign the
      resonances to given atoms.
      </P>
      <H3>Open spectra - 3D TOCSY, 3d NOESY</H3>
      <P>
      We will open two new spectra at <SPAN CLASS='item'>M:Experiment:Open
      Spectrum</SPAN>&nbsp;. In the same directory as the initial experiment, load the
      parameter files <SPAN CLASS='item'>6.spc.par</SPAN>&nbsp; and <SPAN
      CLASS="item">7.spc.par</SPAN>&nbsp; for the HSQC-NOESY and HSQC-TOCSY respectively.
      You can select both files at once by clicking the file names while holding the
      <SPAN CLASS='item'>&lt;Ctrl&gt;</SPAN>
      key. Remember to set the experiment name appropriately for each in the lower table.
      Now set <SPAN CLASS='item'>Skip verification dialogs</SPAN> to ON - as I know that the 
      Azara parameter files are all OK and click <SPAN CLASS='item'>[Open spectra]</SPAN>.
      </P>
      <P>
      Either from the top of the new window that has just been created select <SPAN
      CLASS='item'>[Detailed Settings]</SPAN>&nbsp; under the <SPAN
      CLASS='item'>Contours</SPAN>&nbsp; tab, or via <SPAN CLASS='item'>M:Experiment:Edit
      Spectra</SPAN>&nbsp; select .<SPAN CLASS='item'>[Contour levels]</SPAN>&nbsp;. Then
      from the contour levels popup set the appropriate <SPAN
      CLASS='item'>P:Experiment</SPAN>&nbsp;. For both of the new spectra switch off <SPAN
      CLASS="item">negative contours</SPAN>&nbsp; and set <SPAN CLASS='item'>Number of
      levels[]</SPAN>&nbsp; to 10. Then, for each set the <SPAN CLASS='item'>Base
      level[]</SPAN>&nbsp; to a value that is just above the noise.
      </P>
      <P>
      When the experiment type popup appears set the type of the HSQC-NOESY 
      to <SPAN CLASS='item'>H[N]_H.NOESY</SPAN> and the TOCSY to
      <SPAN CLASS='item'>H[N]_H.TOCSY</SPAN> then <SPAN CLASS='item'>[Close]</SPAN>.
      </P>
      <P>
      In the menu <SPAN CLASS='item'>M:Experiment:Edit Spectra</SPAN>&nbsp; 
      you can set the contour
      colours of the new spectra to something distinctive.
      </P>
      <P>
      You will notice that in the new, three-dimensional spectrum window that there is an
      extra scroll bar at the bottom for the extra dimension. Here, you can move the
      position of the slider to select any region of orthogonal planes. The depth can be
      changed by dragging with the left mouse button, or by setting a PPM position in the
      <SPAN CLASS='item'>15N[]</SPAN>&nbsp; box. Also, you can grab the sides of the slider
      with the middle mouse button to change the width of the region that you're looking at.
      </P>
      <P>
      If you open the <SPAN CLASS='item'>Spectra</SPAN>&nbsp; panel at the top of <SPAN
      CLASS='item'>window2</SPAN>&nbsp; you will notice that there is a button for each of
      the mapped spectra. You can use these buttons to toggle the display of each the
      spectra within its window. Thus we can display either, none or both of our
      three-dimensional spectra. This is particularly useful when picking crosspeaks, as
      the peak picking routine works only upon the contours you have displayed.
      </P>
      <H2>5. Pick and assign 3D Spectra</H2>
      <P>
      Next we will go on to assign the 3D spectra to the 'root' resonances that we created
      for the HSQC. </P>
      <P>
      Choose the isolated, backbone amide peak in the HSQC spectrum at 1H,15N ppms
      7.12,119.5. Mark this peak by holding the mouse cursor over its centre and pressing
      the <SPAN CLASS='item'>&lt;m&gt;</SPAN>&nbsp; on the keyboard. This mark will show up
      in <SPAN CLASS="item">window2</SPAN>&nbsp; at the equivalent PPM values. Then, with
      the cursor over the same peak use the right mouse button to select <SPAN
      CLASS='item'>R:Navigate:1H 1H 15N in window2</SPAN>&nbsp;. You will notice that
      this command has changed the viewpoint in <SPAN CLASS='item'>window2</SPAN>&nbsp;.to
      cover the appropriate 1H,15N positions (horizontal and depth) for the HSQC peak.
      Making sure that the 3D spectra are toggled on and that the depth range is not too
      wide, you will see the columns or 'strips' of the 3D TOCSY and NOESY.
      </P>
      <P>
      Pick the peaks in the TOCSY and NOESY which correspond to the marked NH position.
      Zoom to an appropriate level and drag a box over the whole column of peaks (left
      mouse + <SPAN CLASS='item'>&lt;Shift&gt;</SPAN>&nbsp; + <SPAN
      CLASS="item">&lt;Control&gt;</SPAN>&nbsp;). If none or very few peaks are picked,
      then try widening the depth range a little, as a peak will only be picked at the
      maximum in the depth dimension, and this may not be within the current range.
      </P>
      <P>
      Now we will assign the common 1H and 15N dimensions of all of these peaks. To do this
      we will assign one peak to the same resonances (and hence spin system) as the HSQC
      peak, and then spread this assignment over all the peaks. Assign one of the peaks by
      putting the cursor over its centre and selecting <SPAN CLASS='item'>R:Peak:Assign
      ...</SPAN>&nbsp; from the right mouse menu. Then in the Edit Assignment popup assign
      the first 1H dimension and the 15N dimension. To do this just click on the lines of
      the right hand tables. You will notice that these assignment tables have several
      options, from these just select the same resonances that are assigned to the HSQC
      peak. If you make a mistake and want to change the resonance assignment just select
      the offending resonance in the left hand tables and click <SPAN CLASS="item">[Clear
      contrib]</SPAN>&nbsp; or select a different resonance to replace it. Now you can
      <SPAN CLASS="item">[Close]</SPAN>&nbsp;. the assignment popup.
      </P>
      <P>
      Returning to <SPAN CLASS='item'>window2</SPAN>&nbsp; you will see that the peak
      annotation has be updated in light of the assignment. Next we will spread this
      assignment to the other newly picked peaks in both the NOESY and TOCSY. Left click on
      an empty part of the spectrum to deselect any peaks then drag a box over the 3D TOCSY
      and NOESY peaks (left mouse + <SPAN CLASS='item'>&lt;Shift&gt;</SPAN>&nbsp;), taking
      care to select the assigned peak with the others. Then select <SPAN
      CLASS='item'>R:Assign:Propagate assignments</SPAN>&nbsp;.from the right mouse menu. The
      assigns, as long as they are within chemical shift tolerances, will be applied to all
      the selected peaks.
      </P>
      <H3>Assign to atoms</H3>
      <P>
      Once we posses sufficient information, the resonances to which crosspeaks are
      connected may be connected to specific atoms. For the purposes of this tutorial we
      will cheat with prior knowledge and link the spin system that we have been working on
      to Leucine 21.
      </P>
      <P>
      All we have to do is choose any peak that we have assigned to the new spin steam and
      connect its resonances to 21 Leu Hn and 21 Leu N. With the cursor over the centre of
      the peak, select <SPAN CLASS='item'>R:Assign:Assign peak</SPAN>&nbsp; from the right
      mouse menu. Once the popup appears select the first hydrogen resonance (to left
      table) and then click on <SPAN CLASS='item'>[Assign {1}[1]]</SPAN>&nbsp;. This will
      bring up the Edit Assignment popup. Here, make sure that the hydrogen and nitrogen
      atoms are displayed (click <SPAN CLASS='item'>[H]</SPAN>&nbsp; and <SPAN
      CLASS='item'>[N]</SPAN>&nbsp;), then scroll down to click on <SPAN
      CLASS='item'>Hn</SPAN>&nbsp; in the 21 Leu column. Return to the Edit Assignment
      popup and now click on the nitrogen resonance (lower left) and then <SPAN
      CLASS='item'>[Assign {1}[2]]</SPAN>&nbsp;. Return to the Atom Browser and now click on
      21 Leu <SPAN CLASS='item'>N</SPAN>&nbsp;. You will note that the atom sets you have
      chosen in the browser will change colour to reflect their assigned status.
      </P>
      <P>
      Now that the Resonances are connected to atoms you will see that the peak annotations
      have changed to <SPAN CLASS="item">21LeuH&nbsp;-&nbsp;21LeuN.</SPAN>&nbsp;, not only for the
      peak we directly assigned, but also for all of the peaks, including the HSQC peak,
      that are connected to the same resonances. If you look in <SPAN
      CLASS='item'>M:Assignment:Spin systems</SPAN>&nbsp; you will also see that the spin
      system has been unambiguously assigned by virtue of our choice of atoms.
      </P>
      <P>
      During these atomic assignments it is often useful to have representative chemical
      shift values for the possible atomic assignments. These can be accessed at any time
      at <SPAN CLASS='item'>M:Molecules:Ref Chemical Shifts</SPAN>&nbsp; and selecting the
      appropriate residue code and atom types (heavy atoms or hydrogens).
      </P>
      <H3>Assign a connected residue</H3>
      <P>
      Next we will make an inter-residue connection. In <SPAN
      CLASS='item'>window2</SPAN>&nbsp; mark (<SPAN CLASS="item">&lt;m&gt;</SPAN>&nbsp;)
      the NOESY 21 Leu derived peak just below the diagonal at 7.4 ppm. Returning to <SPAN
      CLASS="item">window1</SPAN>&nbsp; you will note that two vertical lines are present
      on the HSQC, one through the 21 Leu spin system and the other at the Hn shift of a
      nearby residue. Looking at the HSQC along the line at 7.4 ppm we see that two peaks
      are intersected, although neither is dead centre (the marked NOESY peak is distorted
      by the diagonal peak).
      Cheating again, the peak at 111 ppm in the 15N dimension is the residue N-terminal to
      21 Leu.
      </P>
      <P>
      We will bring the 3D TOCSY and NOESY peaks of this neighbouring spin system up in a
      new window stri: In the 2D windows select both the 21 Leu HSQC peak and the peak at 7.36,
      111.0 ppm by (left click and drag with <SPAN CLASS='item'>&lt;Shift&gt;</SPAN>) so that 
      they are highlighed by surrounding squares.
      Now in the right mouse menu select
      <SPAN CLASS='item'>M:Strip:Peak Location Strips:1H 1H 15N in window2</SPAN>
      </P>
      <P>
      Alternatively we could have manually added a new strip to
      <SPAN CLASS='item'>window2</SPAN> and, after having activated the dstination strip,
      used the same navigation function as before in the second HSQC peak.
      </P>
      <P>
      In the new
      strip of <SPAN CLASS="item">window2</SPAN>&nbsp; you will see the neighbouring spin
      system with its return Hn-Hn NOESY peaks. The spin system in this strip is 20
      Gln. So as before, pick the appropriate peaks in the spin system, assign one of them
      to the resonances in the HSQC spectrum, then propagate the assignments to the
      remainder.
      </P>
      <P>
      Finally we will assign the connecting Hn-Hn crosspeaks. In the 21 Leu strip
      select <SPAN CLASS="item">R:Assign:Assign peak</SPAN>&nbsp;
      over the marked peak (just below the diagonal). In the assignment
      popup you should select the 20 Gln Hn resonance for the second hydrogen dimension.
      Now assign the reciprocal Hn-Hn NOESY peak in second strip.
      With the assignment complete, select <SPAN
      CLASS="item">M:Assignment:Assignment Graph</SPAN>&nbsp; and then click on the button
      named after your 3D NOESY experiment. You will then see the connection you have just
      made to the spin systems in the graphical display.
      </P>
      <H2>6. View Peak List Tables</H2>
      <P>
      In the main menu select <SPAN CLASS='item'>M:Crosspeaks:Edit Peak List</SPAN>.
      This will bring up a table of peaks in the peak list - there are many tables like this
      within Analysis for the various data objects. Ensure that the HSQC spectrum is selected
      in the <SPAN CLASS="item">Spectrum:</SPAN> pulldown menu. 
      </P>
      <P>
      Many of the peak functions available in the right mouse menu are also present in this
      popup. However, there are also some
      extra features too. For example you can find a peak in a window by cliking on the
      peaks row in the table and then selecting <SPAN CLASS="item">[Find Peak]</SPAN> at 
      the top right of the popup.
      </P>
      <P>
      The tables within Analysis also have several functions to chcnge the way the data is
      viewed. At the top of the columns there's a feint <SPAN CLASS="item">?</SPAN> which
      allows you to filter out various rows, a <SPAN CLASS="item">[-]</SPAN> which shrinks and
      expands a column and cliking on the top of the column in general sorts the table
      rows according to the entries in that column.
      </P> 
      <P>
      As an example sort the <SPAN CLASS="item">Height</SPAN> column by clicking on its title.
      Then you can select from the right mouse menu
      <SPAN CLASS="item">R:Graph:X Row Number:Y Height</SPAN> to show a graph of these sorted
      values.
