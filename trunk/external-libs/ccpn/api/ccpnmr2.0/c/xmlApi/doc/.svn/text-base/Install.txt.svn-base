CCPN Data Model C API 2.0 installation notes

The CCPN Data Model C API 2.0 release includes all source
code required, including third-party code (if required).

The only third-party application required is Python 2.4.
Users who want to use their own (e.g. system) copies of this
code can do so.

To install the code go into the ccpnmr directory (the top-level
directory of the distribution) and run the installCApi.py script:
 
  python installCApi.py
 
This assumes that your computer has a working version of Python >= 2.4.
The script will ask whether you want to compile Python (2.4), and
if not where your version of Python (>= 2.4) is located.

*********Start of Interlude***************************************
 
Alternatively, if for some reason the script does not work, below is
what you need to do to install the code (CCPNMR_TOP_DIR is the ccpnmr
directory created by the unpacking of the tar file):

(1) If you need our version of Python:
      cd $CCPNMR_TOP_DIR/python2.4
    Unpack tar file:
      tar xvzf Python-2.4.2.tgz
      (or "gunzip" followed by "tar xvf" if your tar does not understand "z")
    Compile code:
      cd Python-2.4.2
      ./configure --prefix=$CCPNMR_TOP_DIR/python2.4
      make
      make install
 
(2) Make C API:
      cd $CCPNMR_TOP_DIR/ccpnmr2.0/c/xmlApi
      make
      make examples       (if you want the example code compiled)

*********End of Interlude*****************************************

After successful installation of the code the following environment
variables also need setting or updating (for example, in .cshrc):

  CCPNMR_TOP_DIR must be set to the ccpnmr directory created by the
    unpacking of the tar file
  PYTHONPATH must include $CCPNMR_TOP_DIR/ccpnmr2.0/python

For example, in .cshrc you could place:

  setenv CCPNMR_TOP_DIR directory_where_you_unpacked_release/ccpnmr
  setenv PYTHONPATH .:${CCPNMR_TOP_DIR}/ccpnmr2.0/python

******************************************************************

You can also optionally install Analysis by running:

  python installAnalysis.py

This requires not only Python >= 2.4 but also Tcl/Tk >= 8.4 and
optionally OpenGL (including glut).
